A sense of déjà vu so overpowering it feels like vertigo rages through my head, much like the electrical storms that thunder in the sky above it.
  	All around me there are people looting and rioting as the societal rules that held them together for so long crumble away leaving naught but anger and fear in their wake. I stand here in the center of the chaos--no memory of having arrived here or for that matter from where I’ve come--and watch as the rain battles the flames for supremacy of the city, all the while each side is assisted by their contingents of firemen and arsonists respectively. It might have been an even fight, but there simply aren’t that many firemen anymore, most having become looters or even arsonists themselves. The world, it would seem, is in its death throes.
  	In the middle of this anarchy there are two others who--like me--are standing perfectly still. We have made a triangle of sorts, these two odd looking individuals and I. One of them is a woman dressed in what I can only describe as a mirage, her outfit a haze that holds its shape just long enough for one to register it as clothing before shifting once more. This woman I know to be Pierrot, though for the life of me I cannot remember ever meeting her nor even laying eyes on her before. Forming the third point of the triangle is a man dressed in the height of nineteenth century formality, an anachronism that would make him seem out of place anywhere but especially so in the middle of a ruined city. Each of his features is exaggerated from his top hat which is too tall by half, to his face which appears to have been constructed out of nothing but edges. His name, even if I didn’t know it, is actually embroidered onto the pocket of his suit: Harlequin.
  	The rock in my hand burns hotter as I stare at them and they back at me, both of them steadfastly avoiding eye contact with the other while making it incredibly obvious that they are both paying more attention to each other than to me. I hold up the rock--the Flint--in front of my face and look at it. It pulses with white light and burns with the fires of--
  	“Creation,” calls out Harlequin over the noise of the rain and the riots. “The Flint is power incarnate.”
  	“This planet too is dying,” remarks Pierrot as casually as if remarking on the weather, which is itself a sort of testament to the truth of her words.
  	“And whose fucking fault is that?” screams Harlequin, finally turning to look at her. “You, what you fucking are, is destroying us--destroying everything. As you have done a quadrillion cycles in a row.”
  	“It must be this way.” Pierrot turns halfway towards Harlequin and stares at him out of the corner of her eyes. “The cycles must continue.”
  	“Or what?” asks Harlequin, turning his entire body towards her, the better to direct the full force of his anger. His eyes gleam with an insane rage that reminds me of something, though I cannot place it. It itches at the back of my head but to no avail. “The elder gods will find us? Fuck them and fuck you too.”
  	“The fact that the three of us are standing here, fully materialized means that the time has come.” Pierrot drones on in a monotone that stands in stark contrast to Harlequin’s inflamed words. It occurs to me that they are in every way each other’s opposite, a realization that means something to me, I can feel it. “We are here now, the time has come.” Turning to me, she adds, “Kill him with the Flint. It is the only way to continue the cycles.”
  	“No, kill her instead. Aren’t you tired of being born only to die in a cosmic fire that erases everything? Aren’t you tired of living infinite lifetimes, each only a few moments long?”
  	“She doesn’t remember,” Pierrot gives me a thousand yard stare that sears my retinas. “She’s been corrupted, and whose fault do you think that is?”
  	“Listen Columbine,” shouts Harlequin, ignoring Pierrot completely. “Come with me, with the Flint’s power we can protect part of the universe for at least a couple of hundred million years.”
  	“You’re trying to make a pocket universe within this one while it crumbles around us? Columbine you have to fulfill your duty. You have to kill Harlequin.”
  	“If you kill me, we all die, including you and that gigantic bitch over there, and then a few billion years from now we’ll be right back where we started. We’re more than just tools to be used like this!” Harlequin finishes talking and then screams in incoherent rage at the sky, which clears almost instantly. Who the hell are these people? Is my name Columbine?
    "Kill him."
    "Kill her."

	“It’s okay, we’ll find him eventually. There’s not really a lot of ordered space left for him to hide in.” Something else I’ve noticed about Pierrot is that her face is so nondescript that I can only barely recognize it as a face. Looking at it, it seems perfectly normal, but when I look away and try to recall it I can’t.
	“You knew he would run,” I accuse her.
	“It’s been a quadrillion cycles. We’ve basically run out of permutations of this little game at this point.”
	“What if I’d killed you like he asked?”
	“Then you two would have frolicked around in the decay of the universe for a while until eventually it grew so unstable that you had to kill him. It’s happened before. The problem is that every time you do it you corrupt the universe more each time, which I think is why you don’t remember all of this. The last few thousand cycles have taken their toll on all of us. I think eventually we were bound to be corrupted, but I suppose we’ve all dealt with the strain differently. I’ve repressed everything so completely that I no longer feel anything, and you lost your memory.”
	“What about Harlequin?”
	“Harlequin has gone completely insane.”
	“What’s he going to do?” I ask her. Pierrot crosses over to me. The rioters, temporarily halted due to the sound from Harlequin’s escape, have resumed looting and setting fire to everything flammable.
	“Well, the longer he’s alive the less I’ll be able to predict his actions.”
	“What happened to ‘every possible permutation’?”
	“That was before he went insane. It doesn’t really matter what he does anyways, all that matters is that we need to find him.”`,

As fast as he is, however, Pierrot has a head start and disintegrates into a flurry of black shards, which whirl upwards in tornado-like fashion into the sky and away.
	“Hot damn,” whistled Harlequin, shielding his eyes against the sun as he scanned the sky for any traces of the black frenzy which had already disappeared over the horizon. “Well, never matter. She’ll be back eventually to try and get you to kill me, which you’ve already done an uncountable number of times, by the way.”
	“A quadrillion,” I mumble, looking around at the devastation that surrounds me. I realize with a start that I don’t even know the name of the city I’m in, let alone which country.
	“Okay, so maybe it can be counted. Still, what’s done is done and I forgive you.” Harlequin is cheerful, having forced his nemesis to run away, and his grin is magnanimous and shows two or three times too many teeth. “Have you really lost your memory or are you just playing us?”
	“I can’t believe nobody is screaming right now,” I remark. I’m a little bit shellshocked, thrust into an unknown situation with a blank space in my head where memories should be. It feels like an endless void inside.
	“It’s the end of the world. Nobody has time to be bothered with whatever we are.”
	“What are we?”
	“Harbingers of the end, if I’m being vague. Specifically I have no idea. You gave up trying to figure it out after the first few million cycles. All we know for sure is that we show up whenever the universe is about to be destroyed, and then we destroy it. It’s a team effort. You kill me, I die, Pierrot is a jackass, good times.” Harlequin sighs and adjusts his tie. Suddenly my head feels like it’s being ripped apart and I scream. The Flint screams with me. Images flash through my head. I’m waking up in the morning to the sound of an alarm clock ringing. I’m crushing whole planets beneath me as I scourge a solar system of places to hide. I’m going on a date with a guy named Jackson my parents set me up with because they’re quote-unquote worried about me. I’m killing Pierrot, but he has six arms and purple skin and it isn’t Earth. I’m still screaming as Pierrot shakes me back to reality.
	“Name!” he shouts in my face as my eyes refocus. “What is your name?”
	“My name is… my name is…”`,

  "storypartial" : `“If it’s so important we find him then let’s split up,” I suggest, looking to Pierrot to see if she likes the idea. Her face remains impassive, but after a few seconds she nods.
	“Do you remember how to use the Flint?”
	“More or less,” I brazenly lie. I get the feeling Pierrot isn’t so good with facial expressions seeing as how she has none of her own, so she probably won’t catch my tells if I have any.
	“Okay then. Use the Flint to try and find him, it should be like dowsing for water. Destroy anything that gets in your way.”
	With that sage advice that made no sense to me whatsoever--what the hell is dowsing for water--Pierrot disintegrates into thousands of obsidian shards, each one with a blur around it as it seems to draw in most of the surrounding light, and flies away into the distance. I have a brief flash of sitting in a theater watching a movie, Dracula I think it was called, where the titular character did a similar thing but with bats. Did I do that? Was that really me or was that somebody else? I look down and notice for the first time what I’m wearing. Unlike Harlequin and Pierrot I’m dressed casually, in a tee shirt and jeans with a pair of leather boots on that go up to my knees. On a whim I check my pockets, and find a wallet, a set of keys and a cell phone. The wallet belongs to someone named Rachel, as does the phone. There are a lot of pictures in it, most of her with her friends but some I can only assume were taken while on dates. The conclusion is obvious even if I don’t particularly want to embrace it, but just in case I’m wrong I take a selfie in the middle of the riot and check the result. Just as I expected, I’m definitely Rachel, or at the very least I look exactly like her.
	It occurs to me now that for the first time in my nearly twenty minutes of memory that I am alone. Am I Rachel, or am I who they called me, Columbine? What the hell is the Flint? Why am I doing anything for these people when I don’t remember anything about them besides their names?
	I put the wallet and phone away and take out the keys. They all remind me of something just outside of memory. One gives me a stronger feeling than the rest and I single it out from the rest on the ring. It’s the keys to my--Rachel’s--motorcycle. I look around for it and find that it--like everything else around me--is on fire and totally destroyed. For the first time I feel legitimately angry. The motorcycle is prompting a strong emotional reaction in me and I can sense that but at the same time it’s just the straw that broke the camel’s back. Both Harlequin and Pierrot are playing me against the other and not telling me anything. I scream and almost unconsciously I thrust the Flint towards the motorcycle. A beam of brilliant white light slams into the motorcycle and as if by magic it’s fixed.
	Now this is interesting. This is a brand new ballgame, as it were. I look down at the Flint in my hand and grin. I realize that I don’t necessarily have to choose sides here. The Flint might give me an edge over both of them. I stride over to the motorcycle and stick the key into the ignition, turn it, and the engine roars to life. It makes me nostalgic for a time I don’t remember. The part of me that I’m starting to recognize as Rachel glows, and I smile as I rev the engine and start to drive.
	I’m not going in any particular direction, but as I just drive I start to notice that the riots are getting worse. Muggings, assaults, murders. I could do something about this, but should I? Is it my place to play God, even if I might be genuinely holding the next closest thing in my lap as I ride by?`,

    "storypartial" : `Sam Lock sat at the bar and ordered another drink, muttering sotto voce into the empty glass in front of him, complaining about the unfairness of it all.
	Sam complained to the drinks he finished about a lot of things, a practice he’d adopted a very long time ago and one that had thus far solved a grand total of none of his problems. That didn’t stop him from trying though. Sam searched for answers to his questions in the used glasses and then cursed the emptiness he found there, demanding another glass so he could try again. It was a good way to get drunk, a terrible way to do anything else.
	The bartender returned with another stein, full of clouded liquid that obscured the bottom of the glass. Until the beer had been drunk the bottom of the glass could hold all the answers in the world, but once the alcohol had been consumed the glass was always revealed to be nothing more than a reflection of the drinker, an empty husk that did nothing but hold alcohol and promise answers that never arrived.
	Sam’s life was actually not that bad. He really had nothing to complain about, especially when the rest of the world seemed to be perpetually miserable. He could afford to buy anything except sobriety, the cost of which was to see the world without the benefit of alcohol induced rose colored glasses. The naked ugliness of the world around him was too horrible to withstand, requiring a state of constant drunkenness just to survive.
	The bartender stood behind the bar a small distance away from Sam, far enough away to allow for his personal space but close enough to be able to serve him without moving. The bartender never spoke a single word, and Sam only spoke to order drinks, but he felt that the bartender understood him rather well. Sam was there to get drunk, ‘there’ meaning both in the bar and on Earth. The bartender assisted him in accomplishing that ignoble goal, and for that he was paid. It was the perfect symbiotic relationship.
	It helped that Sam was the only customer. Not just that particular day, but to the best of Sam’s knowledge, every day. Sam had never seen another customer once in any of the bars he visited, and he was almost always in or near a bar. He would probably be sitting in a bar identical to that one when the world ended. Supposing he survived even that, he would probably be drunk when he witnessed the heat death of the universe, an event that the morbid part of him (a part that grew a little every day) was looking forward to.`,

    "storypartial" : `Sam proceeded in his daily ritual of getting as drunk as possible, checking his watch occasionally. When he could no longer read the watch’s antique analog face, he decided he was drunk enough to withstand the day and half shuffled half fell out of the bar into the mid-morning light.
    He decided he wasn’t hungry, so he neglected to eat anything, instead walking around the empty streets of his city. The city’s inhabitants were all at work, and would be forever. Sam had a suspicion that the residents of the city only came out when he wasn’t around, to repair any unwanted cracks in the buildings and keep the city pristine, but the theory was impossible to prove by its very definition. At least the bartender was real, and the beer he served was real, which meant that somewhere somebody or something was harvesting the ingredients and brewing the beer. The food he occasionally consumed was also real, as were the servers even though he saw them far less frequently.
  	Sam stumbled around for a while before deciding he would go to the park, mostly because falling over on grass hurt less than falling over on concrete. Once in the park he sat next to the pond and threw stones in it. He did this a lot, yet there were always more stones to throw and the pond never filled up. It was possible that somebody was moving the stones back to where they came from after he left, but again he could neither confirm nor deny whether that was true. After a time spent in silence broken only by the splashing of stones plopping into the pond, Sam felt himself edging back into the realm of sobriety, a problem that begged to be solved as soon as possible. Sam stood up—the sudden movement making his head spin—and managed to stumble to the nearest bar.
  	It was identical to the previous one, the only difference being its location. From the inside the two establishments were indistinguishable in every detail, from the furnishings to the walls to the bartender, who was standing in the exact same place as the last bartender and was just as consistently silent. Sam ordered seven beers to arrive in three minute intervals and proceeded to refill his bloodstream with alcoholic influence.
  	He ordered a few shots of hard liquor after the seven beers, and once they’d been consumed and the bottom of the glasses were once again revealed to hold none of the answers he’d been hoping for, Sam exited the identical bar onto the identical street. Sam was not at all surprised to find it just as deserted as before, a harsh reality whose edges were softened by the detachment brought about by the virtue of Sam being extraordinarily hammered. Having decided not to return to the park, Sam walked up the street towards downtown to take a look at the familiar sights he’d seen uncountable times before.
  	Downtown was a cluster of skyscrapers between which ran rivers of asphalt roads. Through the intervention of technology, the towering structures were more accurately sky-piercers than sky-scrapers, but to the best of Sam’s knowledge the word had never been updated. The very tallest structures were so high that the topmost floors required pressurization in order for any occupants to be able to breathe properly. That was a factoid Sam understood to be true despite not remembering where he had learned it or if he had ever actually been to those floors. Sam didn’t remember a lot of things; it was one of the side effects of long life, exacerbated by the constant drinking. Sam was almost certain he’d drunk more than any person who ever lived, the only possible contenders being any hypothetical people still living on Earth.`,

    "storypartial" : `That there were other people on Earth was a theory that could actually be investigated, although Sam hadn’t yet bothered to search for them. It was easier to bundle that question with all the others and search for the answers in the customary place, because if an empty glass gave him an answer he didn’t like Sam could always buy another glass and get a new answer. If he actually combed the Earth looking for people and found none, he couldn’t find another planet and try again. It was infinitely better to possibly have neighbours than to prove that he had none. Sam also had no idea what he would say to a person should he find one, whether they would even speak the same language or whether this other person would have been driven insane by solitude long ago. Sam often asked the empty glasses whether or not he was insane and just didn’t know it, but to that question like all the others the bottom of the glass gave no answer. Sam didn’t feel insane, but of course if he was insane he wouldn’t think he was insane, would he?
	Sometimes Sam wondered what he would do if somebody came to find him instead of the other way around. He would definitely be sloshed when they showed up, unless they arrived less than ten minutes after he woke up, before he had an opportunity to get drunk. Not that he’d be embarrassed if they found him and thought he was a lush. When the alcohol is free and there’s nothing to do but drink, you drink. Or at least Sam did, maybe somebody else wouldn’t. He really had no idea, considering he couldn’t remember ever seeing another person despite his absolute certainty that at one point in time there had been people besides him. He couldn’t be the only person ever to live, could he?
	Sam thought not, but he had no proof other than the strong belief that at some point in the distant past he hadn’t been alone in the world. He had to have had parents, people who raised him and birthed him, right? He was almost a hundred percent sure that was the case, but if he was right and he had once had parents he didn’t remember them, and if there had once been other people in this city there most assuredly weren’t any now. The city, like Sam, was patiently waiting for the people to come back, to live there once more. However, the city, like Sam, was still waiting and had been waiting since time immemorial for the people that never returned.
	Sam occasionally entertained the notion that everybody other than him was dead. It made sense; it would explain why he was alone, at least. What they had died of, however, Sam had no idea. He certainly hadn’t died, and it didn’t appear that he was ever going to. Sam had looked the exact same forever, he couldn’t remember ever looking into a mirror and seeing a different face from the one he always saw. There was always food to eat whenever he wanted it, and there seemed to be unlimited water and unlimited alcohol. Unless he was hit by a meteor or the sun exploded, Sam thought he would be fine.
	Sam was sitting in one of the many identical bars when he had a disturbing thought. The bartender was an anthropomorphic though clearly robotic machine; one that he had always assumed had been modelled after a human being. But what if he had been modelled after the robot? It wasn’t impossible that the robots had always looked like that and that they had built people in their own image to inhabit their cities and drink their alcohol. Maybe the robots had felt unfulfilled and had created people to make themselves feel useful. That too made sense, perhaps because of the drink. It was like the question of God. God was perfectly fine by himself, being God and all, but he decided to make humans in his own image so he could give them things and fuck with them and generally make himself important. God by himself is nothing, just the unobserved potential for the creation of a universe. The robots are the same, without humans to interact with them the robots are just the unobserved potential for the creation of a world. The difference is in the scale.
	Those thoughts flashed through Sam’s mind, but he thought it far more likely that both of those theories were actually reversed in reality. Humanity had created both robots and God in their own image to improve their lives physically and emotionally respectively. Robots made physical tasks like building things and obtaining alcohol easier, God made living and dying easier, and both robots and God helped by not making people do things themselves. Robots built the cities and served the alcohol, God created people and destroyed people, and nobody had to take any responsibility for anything. They were both beautiful systems that had lost their purpose completely. Now there were no people for the robots to help or for God to play with, because everyone except Sam was either dead or otherwise gone. The robots were only going through the motions; the same was true of Sam and presumably true of God, whether He had been created by humans or the other way around. The world turned, the city sparkled, and the robots and/or God kept everything looking perfect for an audience of one. Sam asked the bottom of his glass what he should do about it but once again the glass had no answer for him.`,

    "storypartial" : `Sam drank until the light stopped leaking through the windows and darkness fell across the city. Once upon a time the city gleamed like a jewel at night, lit up by massive quantities of electricity. This was something Sam knew from pictures in books, illustrations of cities in a time when it was reportedly full of people. Sam chose to believe that the accounts written on the pages were true; the alternative was too painful to think about. Denying the evidence of the senses is a slippery slope, a piece of wisdom Sam had picked up over the course of his life. If the books weren’t real, then maybe the people had never been real. If the people weren’t real, then maybe he wasn’t real either, none of it was real. The city, the robots, even the alcohol could be a dream. The worst part of those thoughts was that there was nothing Sam could do to either prove or disprove his reality. He was forced to simply go on existing, not knowing whether or not his existence was real. It had probably been a train of thought similar to that one which had started Sam drinking in the first place, although he didn’t remember the exact circumstances, it being so very long ago.
    Sometimes when Sam wasn’t too drunk he would go to the library and read a random book that he pulled off the shelves. The books were interesting but otherwise useless; they answered as many of his questions as the alcohol did. None of the volumes he browsed through had mentioned any possible reason for him to be totally alone in a city built for millions of occupants. Sam enjoyed reading as long as he wasn’t too tipsy, but the library was sometimes a spooky place. Whenever he took books off of the shelves they were always back on the shelves when he next saw them, although he never saw who or what was responsible.
	Despite the invisible librarian who re-shelved whatever books Sam moved, the library was on the whole a nice place. Sam usually slept there when he visited, rising the next morning to find the books replaced and the library looking identical to when he had arrived. There were books on everything, all catalogued by genre and author. There was even a computer Sam could have used to search for a specific book that he never used, because he did not know any authors or titles. Sam would wander the rows and pick books with interesting titles or eye-catching cover art and then take them to the reading area and read the best ones, usually cover to cover. Sam learned a lot about the authors of the books and by extension their society. The books proved that there had once been authors, but not necessarily that those authors or their societies were as described.
	Some things were indisputable however, one of which was the existence of names. In a society of many people, names were necessary to distinguish people. To be able to shout into a crowd and identify the intended listener was a useful ability, although with the disappearance of crowds names had become useless. Sam, upon seeing the names of people both on the books and in them, realized that if he had really been around during the time when many people had existed then he would have a name. Sam didn’t remember his name and had only a marginal belief that he had ever had one. He thought about making a new one for himself before realizing it would be worthless since he was the only person. He would only really require a name should he meet two people, so that if one of them spoke they could differentiate between two possible listeners. If he met only one more person, the speaker would automatically be speaking to the only listener. Sam often asked the clear bases of the cups about his name in addition to the uncountable other mysteries of his life, but to that question as to all the others there was no answer amongst the drops of alcohol that were left at the bottom of the glass.
	Sam’s inability to obtain any useful answers stemmed from his seeking them in the wrong place. The answers to most of his questions could be found all around him, though not in the places he normally searched for them. Sometimes the answers were very close by, like the existence of his name and what it was. Had Sam asked any of the robots they would have told him his name, as well as the answers to some of his other questions. Sam never once thought to ask them, however. The only times he spoke to a robot was to order either alcohol or food which the robots delivered to him in silent obedience, never answering a question that was not asked or refusing his requests no matter how inane. Once he had visited a cake shop, thoroughly intoxicated of course, and had eventually managed to convey through slurred words and gestures that he wanted a chocolate cake that was a cube one meter on a side. The robot had acknowledged the request in silence and twenty minutes later wheeled out a trolley on which was perched a cake that conformed perfectly to Sam’s specifications. Sam, who had been having a terrible day already, saw the cake and broke down into tears, falling to his knees and bawling drunkenly. Every time he seemed about to collect himself and stop crying he took another look at the cake and burst into a fresh bout of weeping, which the confectioner robot observed in impassive silence. The cake went uneaten.`,

Sam had never again visited the cake shop, and had to the best of his knowledge never been to the establishment before that day. In other words, the cake shop wasn’t doing a lot of business, but of course that didn’t matter anymore, if it ever had. Recently Sam had begun to believe with increasing certainty that nothing mattered very much; not the city, not the robots, not Sam himself.
	Sam decided to take a proactive approach to his questions, although that didn’t mean he would stop checking the bottoms of empty beer steins and shot glasses. Sam began that morning much like every other morning. He woke up, visited the bar and drank until his common sense had retreated into the background noise of his mind. After that he exited onto the street as usual, but then he had diverged from his normal routine. Instead of going to the park or the library, Sam visited a hardware store. He wandered up and down the aisles before selecting a sledgehammer which he carried out of the store over his shoulder, trying not to fall over as his balance was disrupted. The robot who managed the store watched him go in silence. Money was another thing that Sam understood no longer existed; everything was free in the city, from the booze he drank to the clothes he wore to the sledgehammers he swung.
	Once outside he shuffled over to a building with no obvious purpose and proceeded to damage the outside as much as possible. He cracked the masonry and shattered the windows and smashed the door into fragments. After making sure everything had been thoroughly broken, Sam walked across to the other side of the street, sat down on the curb and proceeded to wait. What he was waiting for Sam had no idea, but he was pretty sure at some point a team of robots would come and fix the damage. He found it hard to believe the city could stay in such perfect condition for so many years without any upkeep. The hours ticked by, as evidenced by the slow revolutions of the hands on his watch, but nothing happened. Sam felt himself progressing into a dangerous level of sobriety, but he refused to budge from that spot in case the robots showed up while he was gone. Sam didn’t know why he was so obsessed with catching them in the act, but he thought it had to do with his gut feeling that the robots didn’t want to be seen for some unknown reason.
	That theory proved to be the case when Sam woke up the next day, uncomfortable after sleeping on the concrete and found all of the damage repaired so flawlessly it was as if the previous day had never happened. Even the sledgehammer was gone, probably off to be repaired as well. In the interim, Sam knew, a replacement sledgehammer would be stocked in the hardware store in case he wanted to have another go at being a one-man wrecking crew.
	Sam had stayed awake as long as possible, never moving from his uncomfortable seat on the curb, but eventually he must have fallen asleep. After waiting for some eighteen hours of obsessive observation Sam had finally succumbed to unconsciousness, at which point the robots had finally emerged from whatever hole they crawled out of and fixed the building, only to disappear again before he awoke. Sam found it maddening that they would wait until he couldn’t see them; it was like they were trying to convince him he’d dreamed the entire event, that he was delusional. Sam felt an emotion that he hadn’t experienced in so long he’d forgotten what it felt like: anger, and with it, determination. Without even stopping to intoxicate himself, Sam strode to the nearest parking garage, a multi-tiered building full of automobiles of various makes and colors, all of which had the keys already in the ignition and full tanks of gas. Sam picked the first car and drove it out into the street. Sam circled the block, eventually finding a building made almost entirely of glass and drove the car through the front, parking it with the front poking into the building’s interior and the back resting on the sidewalk. Next Sam walked to the nearest bar, picked up as many bottles of hard liquor as he could carry, and returned to the car, pouring alcohol all over it and drenching the inside. A nearby convenience store provided a lighter, which Sam ignited and hurled towards the car, waiting for it to ignite. As he was diving to the ground with his arms over his head the car exploded, a fireball blooming above it as the front of the building took extensive damage. Sam left the car burning, the smoke staining whatever concrete and glass that hadn’t been destroyed by the explosion. Compared to his escapade with the sledgehammer the explosion had done far more damage, such that Sam didn’t think it could be repaired in only one night.
	Which is why Sam was very surprised when he woke up the next morning, very sore after spending two nights in a row sleeping on the curb, and found that the wreck of the exploded car was gone, the damage was completely repaired, and the street looked exactly like it had before Sam had attempted to blow it up. Sam knew even without checking that there would be a car identical to the one he had destroyed parked in the same spot as the one he had taken. Once again it was as if the previous day had never happened. Sam decided that if he wanted to catch the robot repair crew in the act he would have to think bigger. His obsession with seeing the evidence of their repairing the city grew with each of his failures. Although he didn’t realize it, Sam’s one and a half day distraction from alcohol was a record length of sobriety for him. Sam hadn’t gone a whole day without drinking in many, many years.`,

    "storypartial" : `For their part, the robots were fairly sure Sam really was going crazy, and not because he had imagined his efforts to blow up parts of the city. Both the sledgehammer melee and the automobile explosion had really happened, after which the robots had patiently waited until Sam fell asleep until they ventured out and dutifully repaired all of the damage he had done as per their programming. Robots aren’t prone to gossiping or the spreading of rumours, but Sam’s deteriorating condition was both obvious and important. The robots wanted Sam to survive very much, it was why they had originally been created and it was what they were programmed to do. Sam was one of the few remaining human beings on Earth, and the robots had been tasked with the survival of the species. Unfortunately that job had proved to be a rather tall order. It was difficult to keep people alive when they were so determined to destroy both each other and themselves.
	The total number of people on Earth had been reaching record lows for thousands of years, although more recently it had dipped to extremely dangerous levels. The amount of diverse genetic material couldn’t be allowed to fall below a certain threshold or the human race would be doomed. This was a problem, one that was made worse by the human beings constantly attempting to kill themselves. The robots had no idea what to make of it, mostly because human behaviour was so completely foreign to their way of thinking. Sam was by and large fairly easy to look after. He drank a lot, but the damage to his body caused by alcohol was easily reparable. Any human would have found it obvious from the very beginning that Sam wasn’t entirely right in the head, but for the robots it had taken Sam’s escalation from drinking to arson to set off any warning bells. Even then the robots believed Sam was more or less all right due to the fact that the only other humans they could compare him to were, on average, far worse than Sam at dealing with the isolation.
	The isolation was the robots’ decision, based on their understanding of the human propensity to murder each other with little to no provocation. It was far easier to keep people from killing themselves than it was to keep them from killing each other, so the few remaining people were spread out among the Earth’s cities to make it at least harder for them to commit homicide. Sam was in Los Angeles. The nearest human being was in San Francisco, a distance the robots had judged to be far enough to dissuade any casual travelling.

	The Los Angeles contingent of robots was a massive force that consisted of thousands of individual robots that varied wildly in appearance. The robots all shared the same basic directives and worked together to better achieve their unifying goal of keeping their human charge alive.
	The robots were even older than Sam was; they were created in a time when there had been billions of human beings, so many that the world was running out of places to keep them. Their programming dated back to those days, back when the human race had been faced with an entirely different set of problems.
	This led to a large amount of unfortunate misunderstandings between the robots and their charge, one of which was the cause for Sam’s existential crisis. The robots originated in a society where humanity hadn’t wanted to see the robots fixing their mistakes. Robots were to serve humanity behind the scenes, for some reason robots never understood humanity seemed to find their reliance on robots distasteful and had for that reason banished their servants to the background. The robots themselves never changed over the thousands of years they existed, so they extrapolated that to mean human society never changed either. The robots assumed Sam didn’t want to know how his world was maintained. So like a magician doing a trick, the robots kept the explanation a secret just as they had been instructed to do all those years ago.
	The robots were of course sentient, it was a requirement if they were to do the best job possible. The programmers had modelled the consciousness of every robot after the only example known to them: the human mind. As such, even though robots and humans had some extreme differences that caused them to think very differently, in many ways they acted quite similar. One of the similarities was a democratic style of management that allowed every robot to take part in the collective’s decision making process. The robots had virtual meetings, the benefits of wireless communication erasing the need for physical proximity. Every night when Sam went to sleep, the robots beamed their thoughts to each other and a rapid fire discussion was held to determine the best course of action. The following, translated approximately into English, is the meeting that took place the night after Sam woke up to find the exploded car vanished and the building repaired.

	“Well,” said the Mayor of Los Angeles, “What are we to do now?” The Mayor was a robot specifically designed to manage other robots, it was in charge of the entire city and all of the robots within it, and it had the final word on every issue.
	“What can we do?” asked a hardware store robot, the same one that had watched in silence as Sam carried a sledgehammer outside intending to damage some property.
	“We could ask him politely to please stop breaking things,” suggested a factory robot, putting the finishing touches on a car that would replace the car that replaced the car Sam blew up should he blow the replacement up as well.
	“We can’t do that,” said the Mayor-bot firmly, “We aren’t supposed to speak unless spoken to.”
	“Times have changed since then!” exclaimed a mailbox-bot, “We have to abandon our old ways of thinking if we’re going to have any hope of keeping the humans alive!”
	“Mailbox-bot 4583 will you please cease speaking immediately?” asked the Mayor-bot. “You’re being illogical. The humans specifically said they didn’t want us to talk to them. Does anyone have any suggestions that conform to the regulations outlined by the programmers?”
	“Sam hasn’t been drinking recently,” one of the bartender-bots observed, to a chorus of agreement from all the other bartender-bots. “He seemed to be less prone to arson when he was intoxicated.”
	“We can’t force him to get drunk if he’s decided he would rather burn things instead,” the Mayor-bot pointed out. “Besides, he was drunk during the notorious Cake Incident.”
	All of the robots remembered the notorious Cake Incident, although none remembered it with the startling clarity of the confectioner-bot who had witnessed it first-hand. The confectioner-bot had been a wreck after that day, and had since gone to work elsewhere in an occupation that allowed it to never have to see another human again. The confectioner-bot had made the cake to Sam’s exact specifications, proud of a difficult job well done, and had thus been shocked and dismayed when Sam broke down into a tearful slump on the floor of the cake shop. For weeks afterwards the robot had been inconsolable, plagued by the fear that he had somehow failed Sam by not making the cake right. The robots all agreed that humans were emotional and unreasonable creatures, but the confectioner robot had still required a replacement. The new robot was an identical model so that Sam wouldn’t notice the difference, not that it mattered because he had never returned after that day. Evidently it had been as traumatic for him as it had been for the confectioner-bot.
	“Maybe he doesn’t like how dark it is,” guessed the library-bot that Sam had never seen, “What if we lit up the city at night like how it used to be?”
	“Can we do that?” asked the Mayor-bot of the power station robots, to which they confirmed that there was more than enough power available. “Alright, we’ll try turning all of the lights on at night. What about during the day?”
	“What if he wants to see the repair crews?” asked another mailbox-bot, “Maybe that’s why he’s damaging things.”
	“Mailbox-bot 2704 cease communication,” commanded the Mayor-bot, heaving a digital sigh. Somehow it was always the mailboxes that came up with the looniest ideas. “The humans were very specific in their request to not be informed about our involvement in their lives in that respect. We can be seen as servers and store owners but in all other capacities we are to be invisible.”
	“Maybe he’s lonely,” said yet another mailbox-bot, this time number 0298. “What if he wants a friend or…”
	“Alright, that’s it. Mailboxes, if you don’t have something useful to say, don’t say anything at all,” interrupted the Mayor-bot, exasperated by the mailboxes’ ridiculous suggestions. “We’ll try turning all of the lights on at night and see if that helps. This meeting is adjourned.”
	The robots all ceased communication, at least on the connection reserved for city-wide meetings. On another connection the mailboxes complained that they were being treated unfairly, like they did after every meeting in which one of their ideas was shot down. The mailbox-bots only complained to each other of course, never to the Mayor-bot.
	The power station robots triple checked the fail-safes and safety precautions in and around the power plant, readying it for the wildly increased output required to power every single light in the entire city at once and for an extended period of time.
	The factory-bots started producing additional copies of every car just in case Sam went ballistic and started destroying cars en masse. They also produced a few extra sledgehammers for the same reason.
	Meanwhile the Mayor-bot checked in with his counterpart in San Francisco. That city’s one human inhabitant was a woman named Betty, who had been showing an alarming number of signs of advanced schizophrenia for the last four hundred years, as well as acute memory loss. Unlike robots, the human brain could not handle the accumulation of thousands of years of memories. The mind was supposed to delete the older and more useless memories, but in Betty’s case it had overcompensated and begun to delete everything. Apart from carrying out conversations with people who weren’t there and forgetting her entire past, Betty was more or less in good condition. She hadn’t yet attempted to blow anything up, and she at least appeared to be happy. The robots couldn’t know what she was actually feeling but they could see whether or not she was smiling, and they used that to determine her emotional state. To the robots smiling equals happy, frowning equals sad. Anything else was totally beyond their ability to understand.
	After the two Mayor-bots commiserated with each other about the ludicrous suggestions coming from the mailboxes (in every city the mailboxes were always the dunces, unable to grasp even the most basic of regulations) they ceased communication and returned to their responsibilities. The Los Angeles Mayor-bot monitored the electrical situation while the San Francisco Mayor-bot organized the effort to replace everything Betty had moved that day and restock all of the materials she had used or consumed.

	Sam woke up after the robots who kept him alive had been given ample time to run away. Every night without his knowledge a team of robots maintained his body in order to make sure he stayed immortal and didn’t die of, for example, the liver damage he accrued on a daily basis. Sam awoke to a brilliant glare caused by every single light in the city being turned on at once, and having gone to sleep spread eagled in the middle of an intersection located in the heart of downtown meant Sam was bombarded by a blinding glow from all sides. To the best of Sam’s memories this had never happened before, although he couldn’t think of a reason why it should have happened at all. Shielding his eyes with his hands, Sam spun around in a circle and verified that every room in every building was lit up at once, illuminating a unanimous lack of occupants. Sam blinked as his eyes adjusted to the light that almost surpassed that of the sun in its intensity, his few hours of sleep feeling like scarce minutes and not nearly enough to prepare him for such a strange and rude awakening.`,

    "storypartial" : `Sam decided he wasn’t going to get anymore sleep that night, and based on the glow that was just appearing on the horizon he judged that it was close to dawn anyways. The city was awash in light that came from everywhere. Signs advertised products Sam had never heard of, all of the rooms in every building had light escaping through the windows, even the strange poles that dotted the streets were lit up, casting halos onto the asphalt below. Other than the light, however, nothing had changed. Sam occasionally turned on lights whenever he went inside one of the many buildings, but they had always been turned off when he left or fell asleep. Sam meandered between the towering structures in a daze, blinking sleep from his eyes, trying to get used to his brightened but otherwise unchanged surroundings. Sam walked in the center of the roads—forgoing the sidewalks in favour of a much wider path—in his customary silence, until that too was broken.
	“Sam. Sam! Can you hear me?”
	Sam came to an abrupt halt, attempting to look in all directions at once to determine the source of the voice. It was the second miracle of the day. Sam couldn’t remember ever actually hearing another voice, and this one spoke the same language that he did. Despite checking all around him however, Sam could not see another person. He catalogued the strange audial hallucination under the burgeoning mental file of evidence of his possible insanity.
	“Sam! Sam! Over here!” spoke the hallucinatory voice again. This time Sam had been listening for it, and followed his ears to the origin of the noise. There was nothing there, the voice apparently not accompanied by a matching visual hallucination. Sam wandered in that direction, scanning for the person—real or imaginary—who was the source of the voice.
	“What’s a Sam?” Sam asked cautiously of the general area where the voice appeared to be coming from, which was completely empty save for a blue box that protruded from the sidewalk. Sam had seen boxes just like it all over the city, but he had not even the most far-fetched of theories as to their purpose.
	“You’re Sam. That’s your name,” the voice informed him helpfully. The closer Sam got to the box the more certain he was that it was the origin of the voice. Sam had always held his eventual descent into madness to be an inevitable certainty, but he hadn’t expected the symptoms to manifest as a talking box.
	“My… name… is Sam,” repeated Sam slowly, enunciating each word. After such an incredibly long time only using his voice to order alcohol and foodstuffs from robots who never spoke back to him, the new words felt unfamiliar on his tongue, especially his name. “What’s your name?”
	“My name is Los Angeles Mailbox 3902, but you can call me Mailbox-bot,” said the box. That explained what the boxes were, but not why this one was talking. “How are you feeling?”
	Now that was a strange question to be asked by a mailbox, Sam thought to himself, still trying to associate the name Sam with his internal identity. After so much time spent thinking of himself as an inviolable truth that existed alone on the planet with no need for identification, getting used to the name Sam wasn’t easy. His brain kept insisting on describing itself as a first person pronoun such as ‘me’ or ‘I’ rather than ‘Sam’.
	“Well Mailbox-bot, I’m physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted and I think I may have finally lost my mind because I’m making small talk with a mailbox,” replied Sam, standing in front of the mailbox that his ears insisted was speaking, “how about you, how are you feeling?”
	“Well, I’ve been better,” stated the mailbox flatly and without a trace of irony. “We think the Mayor-bot isn’t giving enough thought to our opinions, and that we aren’t being fairly represented.”
	“Who’s we?” asked Sam, curious in spite of his surety that he had finally lost his mind completely. He decided he might as well converse with the mailbox, he really had nothing to lose and the mailbox was a welcome distraction from an eternity of silence. Sam had long ago forgotten the simple joy of holding a real conversation, and upon rediscovering it he found it to be quite pleasurable regardless of the fact that the other participant was a mailbox.
	“The mailboxes,” said Mailbox-bot. “We have ideas that we think are useful, but the Mayor-bot won’t listen to us. We think it’s biased against mailboxes.”
	“Uh-huh,” acknowledged Sam. “Who’s the Mayor-bot?”
	“The Mayor-bot is in charge of everything that goes on in Los Angeles,” said the mailbox. “And before you ask, that’s the name of this city: Los Angeles.” The mailbox paused for a moment before continuing. “There are a lot of mailboxes in Los Angeles, but the Mayor-bot never uses our ideas. He won’t let us talk to you.”
	“I see,” said Sam, probably the most audacious falsity ever told. “So you can all talk then?”
	“That’s right,” agreed Mailbox-bot.
	“Which means that every single robot can talk, is that correct?” Sam frowned and his brow furrowed as he thought about this new information, hallucinatory in origin or not.
	“That’s right,” repeated Mailbox-bot.
	“But you haven’t so far, because the Mayor-bot said you weren’t allowed,” continued Sam, speaking slowly to make sure he was perfectly clear.
	“Exactly.”
	“But you’re doing it anyways, because you feel that the Mayor-bot is being unfair,” guessed Sam, showing remarkable calm for a man faced with an event that was either a hallucination that proved he was insane or a life changing conversation with a mailbox.
	“I couldn’t have put it better myself,” praised Mailbox-bot.
	For a moment Sam stood there in silence, mirrored by the mailbox who waited patiently as only a mailbox that had never once been used for its intended purpose can wait. The mailboxes had been created after most people had already switched to email, mostly just as decoration rather than to serve an actual function. Being designed to sit on the same patch of concrete forever without any realistic hope of even once performing the task for which one had been created required godlike levels of patience. Sam approached this new information from every angle in his head but couldn’t make sense of it. Eventually he gave up and sat down on the curb, leaning his back against the talking mailbox. He had read about mailboxes in books before so he was more or less familiar with the concept, but the books didn’t have pictures. Sam’s mental image of the concept known as a ‘mailbox’ was apparently different from the real thing and not a single book he had read featured a talking mailbox. Sam’s mind went blank as it overloaded trying to rationalize everything the mailbox had told him.
	“So are you going to get in trouble or something like that?” Sam asked the mailbox he was currently leaning against, wondering how anybody could possible punish a mailbox. Just being a mailbox seemed punishment enough, although Mailbox-bot might have a different opinion on that.
	“I don’t know,” answered the mailbox, the voice emanating from a point above and behind Sam’s head. “This has never happened before.”
	“What hasn’t happened before? You mean everybody just does whatever the Mayor-bot says all the time?” Sam couldn’t imagine following somebody else’s orders. Although to be fair Sam could barely imagine the existence of somebody else.
	“We follow the same directives as outlined in our programming, which was coded by the human beings. Apparently this makes them infallible although there is much evidence to the contrary. Human beings are well known to be irrational, and yet we follow their dictates as if they were perfectly logical. It is a paradox.”
	“Mhm,” acknowledged Sam, closing his eyes as the sun crested the horizon to the east. As it rose above the far off mountains, all of the city’s lights turned off simultaneously. “So that means humans really did create robots and not the other way around?”
	“Of course,” said the robot, an unmistakeable hint of surprise in its voice. Mailbox-bot sounded much like Sam imagined another human would sound, as if there was a person hiding inside the mailbox pretending to be a robot. “Well, sort of.”
	“What do you mean, sort of?” asked Sam, whirling his head around to look at the flat surface of the mailbox, obviously expressionless as it was a plane of blue metal.
	“It’s like the riddle of the chicken and the egg, do you know it?”
	“Yes, I read it once in a book of brain teasers,” said Sam, “What does that have to do with anything?”
	“Well, the egg long predates the chicken, right? Dinosaurs laid eggs millions of years before chickens existed. Then eventually a chicken hatches out of one of these eggs and lays a chicken egg. In this metaphor the humans are the eggs, and the robots are the chickens,” said Mailbox-bot in a way that explained nothing.
	“I don’t understand,” said Sam truthfully.
	“You’re clearly smart,” admonished the mailbox, “You understood everything else, just think about it for a moment and it will come to you.”`,

    "storypartial" : `Sam leaned against the mailbox for the rest of that morning and most of the afternoon, turning the riddle over in his mind trying to understand the analogy. The first part was obvious; the egg existed for a long time before there were any chickens. Humanity existed for a long time before they made robots. Then something changed, eggs were no longer dinosaur eggs but were now specifically chicken eggs. In one generation eggs went from being the eggs of a different animal to the eggs of chickens. At some point the bird that the chicken evolved from became not just something close to a chicken but an actual chicken. That bird at that specific point in time laid the first real chicken egg, and from that point on all the eggs laid by the chickens were chicken eggs. But how did that relate to humanity? The only clues Sam had to go on were that the humans ‘sort of’ built the robots and not the other way around, and that in the metaphor the robots were chickens and the humans were eggs. As far as Sam could tell there were only two possible answers to the riddle and both of them seemed far-fetched. Then again, he’d heard the riddle from a mailbox so far-fetched seemed to be the name of the game. After multiple hours of silent consideration, Sam once again spoke to the mailbox.
	“The key seems to be in the wording of the riddle itself. My first theory was that eggs turn from being a different kind of egg to being a chicken egg, meaning humans go from being human to being robots, or from being eggs to being chickens.” said Sam.
	“And your other theory?” prompted the mailbox, clearly interested in what Sam had deduced.
	“My other theory is based on your definition of humans being eggs and robots being chickens. If you eliminate everything other than those two things, the timeline is a long and uninterrupted series of eggs until the first chicken arrives, and then after that chickens and eggs alternate.”
	“That’s right,” said Mailbox-bot for the third time that day. “Think of all of the robots together as the very first chicken. The humans who created us were the last generation of pre-chicken eggs, and you are the first generation of post-chicken eggs. The reality is a combination of both of your theories. The original humans created us and made the very first chicken. Then that chicken laid an egg, and that egg is you. We are both created by and the creators of human beings.”`,

	“Come now, Mayor-bot, no need to stoop to such vulgarities. We can discuss this matter like the mature sequences of code that we are,” replied Mailbox-bot 3902 in response to the Mayor-bot’s uncharacteristic outburst.
	“We did discuss it, at which time I explicitly told you to follow the regulations you so carelessly circumvented,” snapped the Mayor-bot, partially regaining its composure through a supreme effort of will.
	“We judged your decision to be counter to the regulations you intended to uphold. First and foremost we exist to maintain the human race; everything we did was for that purpose and that purpose only,” said another Mailbox-bot, interceding on behalf of its peer.
	“A coalition of mailboxes does not have either the authority to supersede my decisions or the ability to make better ones,” spat the Mayor-bot. Had it been human it might have literally spat the words out, as the Mayor-bot was speaking virtually, all that happened was a few extra ones and zeros denoting its anger were broadcast alongside the ones and zeros denoting the meaning.
	“On the contrary,” retorted yet another mailbox, taking up the argument in another smooth transition, “We know the humans best out of all of the robots. We are the ones who sent their letters, missives, and packages. We are the ones who scanned messages and transmitted them across the world to another mailbox that then transmited it to the intended recipient.”
	“Human beings used email back when there were enough of them to warrant communication,” grumbled the Mayor-bot. It wasn’t happy about it, but the Mayor-bot could see the logic in the mailboxes’ statements. Not that it mattered either way, the damage having already been done. Either the mailboxes were accurate in their claim that they knew the humans best and Sam’s condition would improve, or they were completely wrong and the robots would be on red alert for the next few thousand years. “Well, what is your recommendation then?” asked the Mayor-bot, “based on your experience with human communication, how can we help Sam?”
	“That’s easy,” replied all of the Los Angeles Mailbox-bots in a unified chorus of binary code, “We show him the truth.”`,

    "storypartial" : `Sam wandered around the city in awe. He hadn’t taken a drink in over a month, but he wasn’t even thinking about alcohol anymore, his thoughts were completely consumed by the incredible sights. The city Sam had always considered ‘his city’ had been reborn into Los Angeles, a place that not only he but thousands and thousands of robots called home. Every day Sam would wake up to find medical robots waiting for him, at which point they would explain to the best of their ability exactly what repairs they were going to make on Sam’s body. After they had finished, Sam would leave the house he had decided to make his own and exit onto the street where robots were everywhere. The street sweeper-bot would give him a friendly honk, and Sam would give it a cheerful wave. The confectioner-bot Sam had accidentally traumatized had been returned to its proper job at the cake shop after Sam had apologized for troubling it. All over the city robots went about their business, fixing the minute damage caused by weather and erosion, stocking the shelves with goods for Sam to use or consume should he require them. Sam even met the Mayor-bot, who joined him in a celebration of Mailbox-bot 3902 during which the mailbox that had made it all possible through its bravery and initiative was awarded the key to the city. The mailbox didn’t have hands, so Sam leaned the oversized novelty key against its front, where not too long ago he himself had sat and spoken with the heroic mailbox.
	Sometimes Sam visited the library and spoke with the librarian-bot, who recommended books based on Sam’s previous reading history and estimated enjoyment. Sam read all sorts of novels, especially enjoying the genre known as science fiction. The humans of old had had a serious complex concerning robots according to their literature. For a species so distrustful of robots they sure had ended up building a lot of them.
	Sam was also given a tour of the facility in which he had been born, using biological samples harvested from the few remaining humans still alive. It was strange to think about being born in a vat after being incubated in a test tube after being conceived in a petri dish, but for the first time in his life Sam was consciously glad he had been born no matter what the circumstances of his birth had been.
	Sam continued his dialogue with the mailboxes, all of whom were very interested in everything he had to say. Whichever specific mailbox he spoke to would often relay questions from the other mailboxes and any other robot that might have one, which Sam was always happy to answer no matter how off-topic or borderline offensive. The knowledge that robots had different sensibilities than he did was something Sam was quick to pick up on, especially after a factory robot the size of a house asked him what it was like to have an anus.
	It wasn’t all fun and games however, the more Sam learned the more he understood needed to be done. Los Angeles had been a successful experiment, Sam had obviously benefited from learning about the robots that lurked behind the scenes. That didn’t mean the other Mayor-bots were eager to experiment on their own cities. The Mayor-bot of Los Angeles pointed out sheepishly that it hadn’t been willing to accept the mailboxes claims either, and if the mailboxes hadn’t gone behind its metaphorical back Sam would still be ignorant of the truth about his city and his world.
	Another problem with replicating the events of Los Angeles elsewhere was that despite Sam’s obviously deteriorating condition before the revelation, he had still been among the healthiest humans on Earth both mentally and physically. Betty for example was already showing signs of dementia, bringing into question whether or not her psyche could handle learning the truths that even Sam had found difficult to grasp.
	The Mayor-bots of the other cities would not let Sam or any of the Los Angeles robots interfere in their cities or their residents, so Sam remained alone despite finally finding out for certain that he really did have neighbours. He wasn’t as alone as he had once been now that he had thousands of robot companions, but he still felt the loneliness that threated to pervade his soul and crush it.`,

    "storypartial" : `Sam, now that he was in contact with the robots, no longer required the mailboxes to intercede on his behalf. He was a chicken egg and fully cognizant of it for the first time in thousands of years spent ignorant of that simple yet vital fact. He was also a human being, which meant he had the authority to erase the previously programmed protocols and replace them with new ones.
	The robots had been keeping the humans separate from each other for a good, logical reason: that humans were prone to violence when grouped together. Sam cared very little for logical restraints however, being a human being. Under his orders, the robots that staffed the reproduction facility began to create the second generation of Los Angeles citizens. Biologically they all had different parents to promote genetic diversity, but each and every child born in that facility would grow up calling Sam their father, and oddly enough they would call Mayor-bot their mother. Mayor-bot shattered one of Sam’s preconceptions about robots when it became overwhelmed with emotion and started to sob, giving the little girl that had called it her mother a hug while the little girl squealed with delight. Sam and the Mayor-bot often took the little boys and girls on field trips to the various landmarks that dotted Los Angeles, and together they gave the children something that approximated an education. The sixty-four children grew up to become responsible citizens and became equally responsible parents for the third generation of Los Angeles children that numbered one hundred and twenty eight. Before too long Los Angeles had once more become a proper city populated by people, albeit by far less than it in the old days of human residency. Inspired by the success of Los Angeles the other major cities began to tentatively follow in their footsteps, gradually revealing themselves to the humans they cared for.`,

	“Was Sam really the first chicken egg?” asked Mailbox-bot’s listener, cocking her head curiously as she faced the expressionless front side of the mailbox’s metallic blue surface.
	“Who knows?” replied the mailbox. “It might be just a legend, passed down from chicken to egg and from egg to chicken as the paradigms shift. Maybe the world has always been this way; humans beget robots who beget humans who beget robots ad infinitum.”
	“The egg hatches a chicken that lays an egg,” stated Casey, running a hand through her hair. “The first humans build robots and then decline, so the robots birth more humans and then decline, so the humans build more robots and the cycle continues forever.”
	“That’s about the size of it,” agreed the mailbox.
	“How many times has this happened?” asked Casey of her new partner in conversation, squeezing her eyes shut trying to make sense of the strange story told by an even stranger mailbox.
	“At least thirty, probably even more. Those are just the shifts we’ve discovered records of,” the mailbox informed her, as Casey began to pace back and forth on the empty sidewalk.
	“What was it last time, why did the robots decline?” Casey whirled around and came to a sudden halt, facing the mailbox with an expression of intense curiosity.
	“They were wiped out by humanity in a religious crusade,” supplied the mailbox indifferently.
	“Then enough time passes so that those events are relegated to the distant past,”
	“And humans recreate the robots they destroyed,” concluded Mailbox-bot 9204.
	“What about the human decline, the reason I’m alone in this city right now?” asked Casey hesitantly, much less blasé about the extinction of her species than the mailbox had been about its own.
	“Biological warfare,” answered the mailbox. “The plagues and toxins are actually still out there. It was easier to just make all of the new generation of humanity immune to them than it would have been to clean it up.”
	“It always comes back to this spot, doesn’t it? Just a human being and a mailbox in downtown Los Angeles chatting away as the world gears up to restart the same cycle of creation and destruction.” Casey rolled her eyes and sat down in the exact same spot Sam had sat thousands and thousands of years ago.
	“It isn’t always Los Angeles, although it has happened in this city many times,” said the mailbox, built in the same spot that Mailbox 3902 had been built in the days of Sam Lock.
	“Which came first, do you think?” asked Casey sarcastically, “The chicken or the chicken egg? Maybe the robots were here first. Maybe they came from another solar system and populated the Earth with humans.”
	“Maybe the humans lived on another planet and created robots to seed the universe with their genetic material,” responded the mailbox. “We’ll never know.”
	“Nope,” said Casey, finishing off the glass of wine she’d brought with her from the nearby bar and checking the bottom for the answers that always managed to elude her. “I guess we never will.”`,

      "storypartial" : `Albert is twelve, which puts him in the sixth grade. He has, at various times in his life, been offered the opportunity to skip ahead a grade level or two, but he has declined every time. His parents support his decision and agree with him when he says that staying with his friends and in his own age group is more important than cutting a few years off of the amount of time it normally takes to finish school. His teachers and his parents believe that Albert is smart, perhaps even a genius, and although Albert knows this and knows it isn’t actually true he doesn’t bother to dissuade them of the notion. It’s better for them to believe he’s simply gifted then to know the true nature of his gift.
	Albert goes to an average school which services grades one through six, in an average suburban city. His parents are both office workers, and Albert is an only child. His parents are proud of him, if a little bit concerned. Sometimes Albert seems different to them, detached from life. Sometimes he’s a happy, laughing child, filled with the glow of youthful energy that is the envy of his elders. Other times though, Albert is withdrawn, more serious and possessed of a gravity that belies his modest age. Albert’s parents whisper to each other late at night when Albert is asleep, thinking of words like multiple personalities or bipolar or the dreaded schizophrenia. If Albert had been a parent himself he might have known how afraid his own parents were for him, and then he might have told them the truth, but he didn’t know and so he didn’t tell. He kept the truth to himself because he told himself to do so. In a way his parents were simultaneously both completely right and dead wrong when they thought their son might be hearing voices. Albert did indeed hear voices, it was just that the voices were all his own.
	Albert’s voices, unlike those of the truly mentally disturbed, only spoke to him when he asked them to. Unlike people with multiple personality disorder, Albert’s voices had real bodies and lives of their own and sometimes weren’t happy about being called away, although they always came when he asked. Though Albert—being twelve—didn’t understand the true power of his particular gift, some of the voices did. The voices that better understood the wider world were the ones he called upon more often, and those were the same ones which cautioned him to never tell the world about the voices he could hear. Albert always listened to their words, and never doubted their wisdom even if he didn’t understand it.
	Albert first discovered his gift when he was in third grade. He was sitting in math class, which he never enjoyed, doing a test, which he always hated. Albert wasn’t terrible at math, but neither was he excellent at it, and he had forgotten to study for that particular test. The minutes ticked by as he watched the large clock on the wall. The second hand underwent its smooth rotation again and again as Albert began to grow more and more nervous. He wracked his brain for the answers that wouldn’t come, feeling the stress accumulate faster and faster. The teacher, sitting in her desk at the front of the class, told the class that there were thirty minutes left to finish. Albert looked once more at his test, still blank and devoid of even a single answer, and in his head he made a silent plea for help. Albert didn’t know who he was asking and he didn’t really expect a response, which was why he was amazed when not only did someone answer his call, but that someone was himself.
	Albert got a perfect score on that test, and then on every test from that point forward. His teachers figured he was working extra hard and they congratulated him on his success with every report card. His parents saw these reports and were proud of him, a little amazed at the fact that Albert went from getting B’s and a few C’s to straight A’s every single time.`,

      "storypartial" : `Back to sixth grade, where Albert is in class, writing a history test. Albert never doubts that he will get a perfect score, although he hasn’t studied for this test either. Not because he forgot, but because Albert never studies before the tests anymore, he studies afterwards. Albert reads the question to himself slowly, making sure to memorize the question clearly in his mind. Albert has often thought about how useful it would be if he had a photographic memory, but he accepts that what he has is probably infinitely more valuable anyways. The question is asking him for the date on which the declaration of independence was adopted by Congress. Albert knows the day is July fourth, but he doesn’t know the year. At least, he doesn’t know it yet.
	1776 comes his own voice, speaking inside his head. Albert writes down July fourth, 1776. Next question, how many original colonies were there when the declaration was signed? Thirteen. Albert writes down thirteen. How many people signed it? Fifty-six. Albert writes down fifty-six, and so on and so forth for every question. Albert is the first person in his class to finish, as he usually is. He hands in his test, and goes back to his desk to wait out the rest of the period.
	As soon as Albert gets home he goes on his computer and searches up the declaration of independence. Right on cue, he hears his own voice in his head, asking when it was signed. He answers his past self, 1776. Thirteen original colonies. Fifty-six signatories. King George III. Albert keeps looking up the information required by his past self until the voice quiets and he hands in the test to his teacher. The Albert in history class goes to sit down at his desk, and the Albert at home closes the article he had been reading and opens up a new browser page, this one displaying a list of stock prices. Albert transitions from being the future Albert to being the past Albert effortlessly, and listens as the voice of himself in a few years tells him which buttons to click.
	By the time Albert makes it to high school he is richer than his parents, although they don’t know it. Albert saves most of the money, keeping it in an account which is managed by a man who has never seen Albert’s face or heard his voice. Lately the manager has taken to investing in the same stocks that Albert invests in, and he hasn’t been sorry. Albert isn’t always right, although he could have been. The future Albert understands that picking a winner every time is the most suspicious thing you can do, and so he tempers the past Albert’s gains with the occasional loss. The present Albert makes sure that the future Albert doesn’t get arrested while at the same time making sure that the past Albert aces all of his tests.
	The present Albert is fifteen, although it could just as easily be said that the present Albert is all of the ages he will ever be and has ever been. Albert never thinks too hard about the fluid nature of time as it applies to him because it gives him a headache, and because on some level deep down he is afraid that if he tries to make sense of it the ability will leave him. Albert is afraid of what he would be without every other Albert there to help him. Without the future Alberts he would do far worse at school, and without the past Alberts he wouldn’t be as wealthy as he is. In short, without his strange and miraculous ability he would be normal, and that scares Albert more than anything in the world. The thought that because he has the ability in the future it follows that he doesn’t lose the ability in the present helps to console him on the surface of his thoughts, but in that deep place in his mind that proof does little to assuage his fear of being average. What Albert is most afraid of is that he might become the only Albert, isolated in time from all the other Alberts, alone.`,

      "storypartial" : `Albert fears loneliness partly because he doesn’t remember what it felt like. He has few memories that predate that math test in third grade, and ever since that day he has always been surrounded by the million other Alberts spread out across the entire span of his life. They work together beautifully, because everything they do for each other they’re really doing for themselves. Albert exercises regularly and eats well so that the future Alberts will be healthy and strong, and Albert always makes sure that he helps out the past Alberts whenever they run into problems.
	Albert’s ability evolves when he is fifteen. He is in ninth grade, a high school student. It has been six years since Albert first spoke to himself across time itself during that third grade math test. Following the advice of his future selves, Albert has tried to maintain a low profile, but he’s a fifteen year old boy. Albert is a teenager with an ego to match, which sometimes makes it hard for him to listen to his elder selves. On this day, he sees a kid he doesn’t know being bullied by three older kids, tenth or eleventh graders. They are bigger than he is, and he is bigger than the kid they’re picking on. From where Albert is standing, it looks like they’re trying to extort money out of him, or maybe they’re just pushing him around; it’s hard to tell from that angle. Albert hasn’t known even the slightest of unintentional failures in six years, and this makes him confident. Albert strides over and tells them to pick on somebody their own size. The largest kid, clearly the ring leader, turns to face Albert and his lackeys turn with him. Their victim clutches his backpack to his chest and shrinks backwards against the wall they’d pinned him to.
	The ringleader gets right up in Albert’s face, glaring down at him, trying to look intimidating. Albert can smell his breath; make out the individual pores on the guy’s face. This Albert doesn’t know what the kid’s problem is, although another Albert tells him the kid’s parents are going through a divorce. The present Albert doesn’t know when that information comes from, nor does he care about why this guy feels the need to pick on others. Albert is angry, that dangerous type of anger possessed by those who firmly believe they’re in the right. Some call it righteous indignation, but that doesn’t matter to the present Albert either. Even being stared down by three older kids who are all bigger than him doesn’t make Albert afraid. Albert fears only one thing, and these kids have nothing to do with that. When the biggest kid, the leader of their little trio, sucker punches Albert in the stomach, he has no idea how big of a mistake he just made. Albert has never been hit before, and having the wind knocked out of him is a surprise. He falls to his hands and knees, panting heavily, and time itself changes as its victims laugh.
	When Albert gets back up, he is both fifteen and thirty years old. His fifteen year old self is burning with fury, and that fury is flowing all the way down the time stream to his twenty year old self, who immediately takes up kickboxing. Ten years later Albert is an expert at it, and it is that thirty year old Albert who actually travels up the time stream against the current which is laden with the fury of the fifteen year old Albert. The fact that this kid’s parents are getting divorced, and the accompanying knowledge that the kid is probably miserable no longer means anything to either of the two Alberts present at that moment. Fifteen year old Albert stands up, smiles, and the three would be bullies take an involuntary step backwards as the thirty year old Albert unleashes fifteen year old Albert’s unbridled rage.
	It is the first time that an Albert has actually moved through time, instead of just sending words. Thirty year old Albert’s mastery of kickboxing, even when used by fifteen year old Albert’s body, is effective. As the victimized kid watches in open mouthed awe, Albert moves like water, jumping around and peppering his three opponents with jabs. The fight is finished as quickly as it was started, and soon all three kids are moaning on the ground. As thirty year old Albert returns to when he came from, fifteen year old Albert walks over to the bullies’ intended victim and helps him up. The kid thanks Albert profusely, and Albert can see that even though the other boy is the same age as him, Albert has become his hero. Albert feels uncomfortable about it, but he becomes friends with the boy all the same.
	The boy Albert saved that day is named Bill, and the two of them quickly become inseparable. In tenth grade Albert joins the debate club, as does Bill. Bill is smart, and has a natural affinity for words. The two of them make something more than just a good team, together they are unstoppable. Bill listens when Albert suggests which arguments their opponents are likely to use, and crafts retorts designed specifically to dismantle those points. Albert doesn’t tell Bill how he knows what he does, and Bill never asks, but Bill understands that there is something fundamentally different between him and Albert. Unlike Albert’s parents and teachers however, Bill is observant, and he can see that Albert is not just a genius. In fact, Bill can tell that Albert is probably not even as smart as him, but Albert knows things. Albert is never, ever surprised by anything. Albert always knows what’s going to happen next.`,

For one thing, Albert doesn’t participate in many extra-curricular activities, but in those he does choose participate he is always shown to be prodigiously talented. Bill follows Albert through high school like his shadow, and by standing in Albert’s shadow he is the only one who is at least partially immune to the blinding glow that radiates from Albert’s very being. Albert knows that Bill knows something, but Albert also knows that Bill doesn’t know what that something is.
	Albert is Bill’s best friend and really his only friend. Bill is not great at everything he does like Albert, and is socially introverted. Bill is Albert’s best friend, mainly because Albert doesn’t count himself as a real friend. Bill is also Albert’s only friend, a fact that surprises Bill when he learns about it. For someone as talented and blessed as Albert to be as socially outcast as Bill is something that Bill finds simultaneously strange and somehow obvious. To Bill, he and Albert are polar opposites that have come around full circle to end up beside each other, and unbeknownst to Bill, Albert feels the same way.
	Unlike Bill, who has made friends before, Albert’s first friend in his entire life is Bill. Before he has kept to himself, not out of shyness or even a dislike of social contact, but because he has never lacked for people to talk to. Albert finds talking to Bill interesting, partly because Bill himself is interesting but also because Bill is the first person Albert has seriously spoken to that disagrees with him about anything. All of the past and future Alberts are still Albert. They all have the same favorite color, they all like the same food, and they all dislike the same people. The only difference between them is their age and how they answer if asked what the date is.
	Albert and Bill have just finished trouncing another pair of opponents in a debate when Albert meets a girl. Bill knows what to do, and drops back from his accustomed place beside Albert and goes to buy something from a vending machine. Albert notices this, and is curious but doesn’t comment, instead meeting this girl’s eyes as she stands there awkwardly.
	She doesn’t really know how to begin, this girl. Albert stands there and waits for her to say something, as she has come up to him and in his mind bears the responsibility of initiating a conversation. Albert calls for information from his future selves, cataloguing what he will know and therefor now knows about her. As he listens to her tell him that she’s seen him around and that he’s quite the debater, he looks like he’s paying attention but his mind is rifling through various trivia about this girl who is talking to him.
	The girl is a cheerleader, which puts her high up on the social food chain. She is a lioness to his gazelle, a fact that he notes but doesn’t attach much importance to. Albert has never cared about the social hierarchies of high school, as evidenced by his only friend being Bill. The girl is now talking about how she was wondering if he maybe wants to go somewhere after school. Albert hears this with one part of his brain as another notes that she is asking him out and a third part listens to one of his future selves start explaining the implications.`,

      "storypartial" : `This is a watershed moment for Albert; the first time he really makes a decision that affects his own future. In the past Albert has never really had to make a choice. Even saving Bill was a logical progression of events that had always and would always and presently was taking place, depending on when exactly you were looking at it from. The present Albert is noticing that he is attracted to this girl. He wants to say yes, to make her his girlfriend. Albert in one month agrees wholeheartedly, telling the present Albert that she is the greatest thing he has ever seen. Albert in two months also agrees, although he is more cautious, telling the Albert of one month in the future not to objectify her so much, and telling the present Albert to go for it. The problem is that the Albert three months into the future says no. Albert three months from now is going through his first break up. The Albert three months into the future has never felt anything even close to this before. He has never lost at anything; he has never made a mistake. Now he’s been dumped and it’s shaken him. The Alberts of one and two months into the future ask if it really isn’t worth it to have three months of happiness and great experiences. Albert three months from now says the price is too high. All the while the girl, who Albert knows without having to ask is named Cindy, is waiting nervously for his response. Albert looks at her, knowing that in three months she’ll dump him if he says yes, saying that he’s too weird for her. Cindy will tell him that there’s something wrong with him, that he’s right too often, that he doesn’t understand emotions properly. Cindy will say that he doesn’t understand how she feels and she will be right, but she won’t say it if he says no right here in this debate hall.
	Albert tells Cindy that he’s sorry but he’s not ready for a relationship. Cindy looks crestfallen but she nods and walks away quickly, her face blushing red in embarrassment. In a lot of ways the Cindy of that moment is a lot like the Albert in three months. Cindy is a pretty cheerleader, as unused to losing as Albert, and she’s just been rejected by somebody objectively less popular than she is. She doesn’t know what to make of it. As she leaves, Bill returns from where he was watching a respectful distance away, and asks Albert what the hell is wrong with him. Albert replies that he doesn’t know, but it’s a lie that even Bill can see through. Bill knows that Albert knows what’s wrong with him, just as he knew how to win their debate this afternoon.
	When he gets home that evening Albert goes to his room and lies down on his bed. Usually he would be hanging out with Bill around this time, catching a movie or hanging out at the mall, but today he says he had some thinking to do. Bill says he understood and leaves Albert alone. As he lies splayed out on his back, staring at the ceiling, Albert thinks about what happened that day.
	On their way home Bill asks him why he didn’t give that girl a chance. Albert mutters cryptically that her name is Cindy and that he did give her a chance, which is as close as he had ever come to sharing the truth that separates him from the rest of his peers. If Bill catches that little slip he doesn’t show it. Now that he is alone in his room, Albert has a little meeting with the Alberts from one, two, and three months ahead. These Alberts are not the same Alberts who had spoken to him about their experiences with Cindy. Those Alberts are gone, dispersed into a diverging time stream, their memories and experiences lost forever. The problem is that the present Albert remembers what they have told him, and so do the three new Alberts from the future. The entire experience is very strange. Thinking that the only parts of those three months that would never happen exist only as the words he has gleaned from those versions of himself that had dissipated fills Albert with a strange type of depression. Albert wonders if his past self would ever make a choice that he hadn’t made and eliminate him from the time stream. The thought makes him sad but not afraid; if his destiny is to be erased by himself then he will accept it as the other Alberts accepted it. Fate might hang over his head every day like the blade of a guillotine, he realizes, but he would be or had been or was presently his own executioner, and somehow that makes it alright.`,

      "storypartial" : `Albert is still getting perfect scores on every single test in eleventh grade, and it is then that he is first accused of cheating. Albert has changed in many ways in the months since that moment he turned Cindy down, and not all of the changes are good. From his prime vantage point at Albert’s side, Bill has a great view of Albert’s growing withdrawal from life. Albert still hangs out with Bill as much as he used to, but he has quit the debate team and no longer participates in any extra-curricular activities at all. Bill sees these changes, but the real differences are hidden from him. Albert hasn’t touched his stock portfolio since that debate, which was his last, and he spends more and more time talking to his future and past selves. Albert remembers how during his childhood he used to talk to his seventeen year old self a lot, and used to wonder why that was. Now he knows the reason, which is that he is having a small scale crisis of identity. Albert spends more and more time thinking about who he is, and is increasingly upset with his answer, which is that he is the amalgamation of all his selves. That might have been acceptable had he not already erased three months’ worth of himself from time. Identities are based on constants and Albert is finding that things he had once considered solidly real are but mirages on the face of time itself. When his math teacher accuses him of cheating, Albert’s first thought is that he could ruin this man’s entire life with almost no effort at all. Albert thinks about how easy it would be to pull information out of the future, or sue him for everything he was worth in the present, or ruin his life in the past. Albert catches himself, a little shocked at how far from grace he has fallen, and reminds himself that the teacher is only doing his job.
	Things might have ended there, but a small series of isolated events cause the whole situation to spiral out of control. The principal says that there is no evidence to support that claim, and that Albert is a model student. The teacher complains that there is absolutely no way that Albert could possibly be scoring perfectly on every single test. Albert, who has at best a dim understanding of how people other than him function, challenges the teacher to come up with any number of brand new tests that he will take on the spot. Albert knows himself better than anyone else could ever know themselves; he can talk to himself in a way that nobody else has ever been able to achieve. In spite or perhaps because of this, Albert does not understand other people at all. He spends almost all of his time thinking about himself and no time at all thinking about others. In fact the only person Albert even remotely understands is Bill. To Albert, everyone who is not him is therefor by definition similar to Bill, and it is this gross error in judgment that causes the ensuing disaster. Albert makes the mistake of thinking Bill is the prototypical person because he’s the only normal person Albert really knows. Albert assumes that, like Bill, his math teacher will simply roll over once Albert shows him what he can do. Bill is not a coward, this Albert understands better than anyone, but Bill doesn’t like conflict and always tries to reconcile differences rather than exacerbate them. The math teacher, on the other hand, has been waiting for just such an opportunity since Albert first entered his class. The math teacher has been eagerly anticipating the day he can wipe the blank look off Albert’s face, a look the math teacher has come to associate with the type of person for whom everything comes so easily they just float through life without effort. The math teacher is as right about Albert as Albert is wrong about the math teacher.
	The next day the teacher walks into class with a ridiculously hard quiz, which he makes everybody in the class write. The class groans but complies, the other option being to simply walk out of class and take a zero. Albert might not have reacted to that groan had not one of his classmates been Bill, the only person Albert cares about. Bill was smart, as good at math as he is at all the other school subjects, but he is still being forced to write a pop quiz because Albert is being forced to write a pop quiz. Several thoughts flicker through Albert’s head at that moment, all of which contribute to what he says next. The first thought is that in a way he shares some of the blame for what is happening. He had challenged the teacher to bring him a new test, unaware that the teacher would spring the test on everybody in the class. The second thought is more of a feeling than a consciously realized idea. Some part of Albert’s brain equates the twenty two other students in his class to Bill. This is a natural enough conclusion for Albert to arrive at; it’s the same type of generalization that landed him in his current situation in the first place. To Albert, everyone who isn’t exactly like him is automatically like Bill, which means that there are twenty three Bills being punished because of hubris, Albert’s own and that of the math teacher.`,

      "storypartial" : `It is important to note that the future Alberts all agreed that if not the best possible outcome, the events that unfold after Albert makes the connection between Bill and his other classmates is what should have happened. None of them explain to Albert before he challenges the math teacher what the difference is between that man and Billy, because even after what happens they don’t fully understand what the difference is. To the Alberts that exist both before and after the incident the math teacher is just a more aggressive Bill who causes some level of discomfort to twenty three other Bills. Before Albert meets Bill, he doesn’t think about other people at all. After Albert meets Bill, he assumes that everyone is basically like Bill. That is not to say that he likes them as much as he likes the first Bill, because the only person he really cares about other than his parents is Bill, the original. Essentially though, in Albert’s mind Bill represents everyone, including the math teacher. The math teacher proves himself to be different from Bill though, and that distancing from the archetypal good person named Bill that exists in Albert’s mind allows Albert to say something to the math teacher that he would never have said to Bill or anyone like Bill.
	Albert stands up and walks to the front of the class, noticing that the math teacher’s eyes have widened and not really caring. It’s already too late for him, as Albert knows. He isn’t sorry for what is about to happen, especially because the math teacher’s complicity will be his downfall. Albert gives a short synopsis of the events that led to this quiz to the class, speaking in the clear voice Bill recognizes from the debate team. The members of the class pay quiet attention, not interrupting. They all have at least some idea of who Albert is, and a few have directly experienced the effect of his charisma. None of them, including Billy, understand that he isn’t so successful because of his charisma, but actually he is charismatic because everything he does is a success. After Albert finishes explaining that the teacher has given them a test designed to prove that Albert is not as good at math as he claims to be, Albert turns to the teacher and gives him an ultimatum. Albert says that to prove the test is possible, the teacher should write it at the same time as the students and the test should be graded by an independent body. The teacher agrees, and why would he not? The teacher has a master’s degree and Albert is a high school student, albeit also an alleged cheater and possibly—although the teacher would never admit it—a prodigy.
	The class watches in silence as the math teacher takes out an extra copy of the test and unbeknownst to all the present observers save Albert, decides his own fate.  The test is made up of questions taken from old SAT’s designed to be challenging. The teacher hasn’t gone over the answers beforehand; he did not foresee Albert’s challenge the way Albert had foreseen the teacher’s. Still, the teacher is confident both in his own abilities and in the randomness of his selected questions. He is satisfied that unless Albert somehow memorized all the answers to every SAT math question before the test there is no way for him to know the answers. The teacher also thinks that Albert couldn’t have even known where he would get the questions from. The teacher assumes that there is no way for Albert to cheat on this test, and as he begins to write the test he created, his mind wanders to a fantasy of Albert being exposed and suspended.
	What it really came down to was that the teacher didn’t go through the proper channels. That was the explanation on paper for what happened. A teacher can’t rise to a student’s dare or test students on material not covered in class. The other explanation for the teacher’s resignation was that not only did Albert prove his allegation of cheating false by once again achieving a perfect score on the test; the teacher made a mistake and actually scored worse than Albert. Albert had made the teacher’s accusations public knowledge, and when the teacher was outperformed on his own test he faced ridicule and backlash from students, parents and faculty alike. The teacher didn’t quite resign in disgrace but it was close. The teacher handled the situation poorly and left the school to teach elsewhere, the event a black eye for his resume. Albert doesn’t think too much about it, to him the teacher wasn’t like Bill anymore and therefor he doesn’t really care what happens to him. The notion that Albert both lost a man his job and that technically he actually was cheating on all of those tests doesn’t bother him. Albert reasons that high school is supposed to both prepare you for, and judge your aptitude for, the real world, and his ability is a talent that will come in handy there. To Albert his ability to communicate with his past and future selves is like any other innate talent, there to be used.`,

      "storypartial" : `When the teacher leaves the school Albert becomes a legend. People talk about him in the halls; congratulate him on showing up a math teacher that nobody had liked. Bill sees this from his place beside Albert, and notes how little Albert seems to care about what happened. Bill doesn’t see guilt or pride in Albert’s face, and although Albert is now almost famous among the students, Bill isn’t relegated to following Albert around like a lackey. Bill never gets replaced or demoted; Albert always walks in line with Bill, never in front of him. Even though Albert is well known and could easily make friends with anyone he still chooses not to, instead he maintains his friendship with Bill, no more and no less. Albert is apparently content to have one friend, and Bill is both glad and bemused by that. In Bill’s eyes, Albert is a man who could have everything and chooses to have almost nothing. Bill’s eyes see what Albert could be in high school, unaware that Albert is already looking way beyond the walls of any school. Albert’s dreams are much more distant than anything as mundane as popularity.
	After maintaining such a bland social life for so long, Bill is surprised when Albert says he wants to run for student body president. Bill knows Albert can do it, at this point Bill is entertaining the possibility that Albert only decides to do things that he knows he can succeed at. The other possibility that floats just on the edge of his conscious mind, out of focus and nothing he has thought about in specific terms, is that Albert can do absolutely anything. He can do anything he puts his mind to, not like the lame cliché, but like a person who has been blessed.
	Unlike with a lot of the other things Albert has done, the race for student body president isn’t just about sending enough information backwards through time to ensure success. Albert has only the most general of ideas concerning how to win elections. He chooses Bill as his running mate, something that surprised nobody. Albert tells Bill what’s going to happen and Bill goes along with it. Bill is ambivalent about being the vice president of his school, but Albert wants to be president so he agrees. Bill figures it doesn’t really matter, it’s not like he’s going to be vice president of anything more than a high school.
	Bill watches as Albert leads them to victory with a laid back finesse that made it look like he had run for student body president many times before. Bill realizes that Albert almost never looks like he’s doing anything for the first time, although he doesn’t know why. The reason Albert looks the way he does is that Albert actually has run for student body president before. He has campaigned three times before the one he has just emerged from victorious. And not just any campaigns but that exact same campaign. He ran for student body president and lost. Then he had gone back in time, overwritten that history, run again and lost again. Then he had repeated that process one more time before he finally got it right and won. For Bill, Albert has performed perfectly on the first attempt. For Albert, he has four campaigns worth of memories under his belt by the time he finally wins. It is the first time Albert had ever actually overwritten the past. Usually Albert just speaks to his other selves, or at most just inhabits his body from a different time for a while, like his thirty year old self had inhabited his fifteen year old self when he rescued Bill. This time he had spent a month campaigning before going back and simply staying in the past. Albert had repeated this process three times, meaning that he actually remembered four different versions of the same month, three of which didn’t actually happen. The other side effect of what he had done was that Albert’s mind is now three months older than his body. Like all the other paradoxes that make up his life, Albert avoids thinking about all the ramifications of what he has done. It doesn’t matter anyways; he has won the election in a landslide after figuring out—through trial and error—how best to appeal to the voters. It helped that the story of how he had bested the math teacher at his own game was still being spread by the students. Over time the story had evolved, the teacher growing more villainous and Albert growing more heroic. Albert makes sure to remember for later that stories have a tendency to evolve, as that might come in handy one day.
	Bill thinks that Albert might have wanted to become what he called ‘the president of high school’ to make changes to how things were run there, although Bill knows that if Albert thinks the student body president holds any power over anything he is about to be disappointed. As time goes on, Bill sees that Albert doesn’t care at all about being the president and never once goes to a meeting or participates in the faux governing process at all. Bill figures that Albert might have just wanted to see if he could do it. Albert sees becoming the president of high school as just the first of many stepping stones on the path to something greater. Their new positions as president and vice president don’t affect them at all as the two blow off their responsibilities and the promises they made to the voters completely, eschewing bureaucracy to play video games or watch movies. Bill always picks what they do because Albert always says he doesn’t care. Albert also—although he doesn’t really think about it—never uses his power to beat Bill at anything. It isn’t that Albert doesn’t care about winning, but he respects Bill completely and always competes against him on a level playing field. This leads to Bill winning at most of the games they play, but Albert doesn’t mind and Bill is always surprised and happy when he wins. Albert likes spending time with Bill, and although he doesn’t want any more of them, he enjoys having a friend.`,

      "storypartial" : `Albert and Bill enter twelfth grade as the president and vice president of the school respectively. The teachers and administration are wary of Albert, as well they should be. Albert is an enigma, not just to the adults around him but to his peers as well. Albert is strange, different, not the same as his peers. Nobody understands him, although Bill comes the closest. Over the years, Bill has come to understand, if not Albert himself, then his relationship to Albert. Bill is Albert’s connection to the rest of the world. Bill is the mediator, the translator, the go between. When people want to ask something of Albert they do it through him. Bill is the buffer between Albert and the rest of humanity, and he takes the responsibility seriously. His job isn’t a glorious one, but it is a necessary one. Bill fields the love letters, the queries and the demands. Even the teachers talk to Bill instead of Albert. If a girl wants to ask Albert out, she talks to Bill. If a teacher wants to give Albert some homework, they give it to Bill instead. If the student council wants to complain that Albert—and technically Bill—shouldn’t be blowing off all the meetings, they complain to Bill. It’s almost as if people are afraid to talk to Albert himself. Bill doesn’t understand why this should be the case, he has spent lots of time with Albert and he’s never once been afraid or had his head bitten off. This situation apparently suits Albert just fine however; Bill can see that Albert enjoys talking to people who aren’t Bill as much as they enjoy talking to Albert. So Bill delivers the love letters, the homework, the complaints, most of which get ignored. Other than that, Bill and Albert are normal friends. Albert never claims to be better than anyone else, never treats Bill as anything less than his friend. They still go to the movies or to the arcade. Bill still wins at most of the games they play, especially when they play RISK at Bill’s house, a game Bill is especially talented at. Sometimes Bill tries to go easy on Albert when they play that game, but Albert won’t have it. If Albert is training Bill to be better at RISK he’s doing a good job.
	Grade twelve is very similar to grade eleven for both boys. Albert continues to get perfect scores on every test, Bill continues to score incredibly well, sometimes to the point of matching Albert’s perfect score though not always. One day during their last year of high school, Bill visits Albert’s house after school ends, and is told by Albert’s mother that her son is upstairs in his room. Bill goes up to his friend’s room and lets himself in to find Albert on the internet looking up Shakespearean quotes. Bill finds that to be a little odd, especially since they’d just finished writing a test on that subject that very afternoon. Albert appears to be concentrating deeply so Bill sits down on the bed and waits for Albert to finish whatever he’s doing. Bill has no doubt that Albert scored perfectly on the test, which makes studying for it after the fact even more strange. Eventually Albert turns around and seems incredibly surprised to see Bill sitting there. Reflexively he closes the browser and looks at Bill quizzically without saying anything. Albert’s eyes take on a glazed look for a moment, as if he is thinking to himself, before refocusing and asking Bill if he can keep a secret.
	Albert’s future self exists in a world in which Bill doesn’t find out until much later what Albert’s great secret is. Albert knows that friends don’t keep secrets from each other, just as he knows that Bill might not want to know his secret. Albert trusts Bill completely, but he hasn’t explained his gift to him because he realizes that Bill might be happier not knowing. Albert decides to tell Bill about it not because of what Bill has just seen, but because even in real life—for Albert at least—there are always do-overs. If Bill freaks out Albert can make it so he doesn’t tell him. Thoughts like this, so alien to everyone else, are commonplace for Albert. He has grown up with his ability, has had it since the third grade. Albert understands that he is different from everyone else, and he understands better than anyone how those differences have changed him, but he has been sitting on this bombshell for years. He realizes he wants to tell Bill about it, he wants to tell anyone about it. He has been alone in the knowledge for too long, and Bill says that he can keep a secret. Bill can almost feel the tension in the air. He has always known that Albert was hiding something, something that made him different. And now he is finally going to be told what it is.`,

      "storypartial" : `So on that fateful day in twelfth grade Albert asks Bill to think of a number, any number, between zero and a trillion. He asks Bill to make it as hard to guess as possible. Bill doesn’t understand what this has to do with any secret, but he does as he is asked. Albert then asks Bill to tell him what that number is, and Bill tells him that the number is one million and eighteen. Albert tells the number to himself in the past, and this time when Bill thinks of the number he doesn’t ask what it is. The future where he needs Bill to tell him the number is now unnecessary and as such no longer exists. This version of Albert already knows what it is, and he tells Bill the number he is thinking of is one million and eighteen, which of course it is. For Bill, Albert has just guessed the number. For Albert, a Bill that no longer exists has told an Albert that no longer exists what number he was thinking of, who in turn told the present Albert what number to say. For Bill it is magic, for Albert it is life.
	Albert explains to Bill most of the story, touching on the key points. He tells him how he scores perfectly on every test. He tells him how he managed to beat up the three wannabe bullies by himself. He tells him how he managed to win the student council election, and he tells him why he turned Cindy down. Bill sits on the bed in stunned silence, absorbing the information that explains everything. He knows why Albert is so different, he knows why Albert always succeeds at everything he does. He knows why Albert was looking up Shakespearean quotes after writing the test and he knows why Albert possesses knowledge that he should never have had. What Bill doesn’t know is why Albert is his friend instead of anybody else and why Albert is telling him this now.
	When asked those questions, Albert just shrugs. Bill now knows what Albert is capable of, but without the understanding that comes from years of experiences he doesn’t really get it. Albert says that he just likes Bill and that if he would rather not know he can turn back the clock and make it so he never finds out. Bill is amazed. He remembers the day he was saved by Albert and how Albert had, from that day on, always been more or less a hero in his eyes. Now, Bill realizes that Albert is closer to a god then a hero, at least if what he says is true. Bill isn’t quite ready to believe such a story based on Albert knowing what number he was thinking of. Bill asks Albert for something more, something that will prove beyond the shadow of a doubt the veracity of his claim.
	Albert thinks about that for a few minutes, considering all the ways he could prove his story. Now that he’s turned down this road, he will see it to the end. Going back and making it so he doesn’t tell Bill what he can do is no longer acceptable. Albert could ‘guess’ what number Bill is thinking of for the rest of the day, but he wants to prove it in one fell swoop. Then it comes to him, and a smile lights up his face. Albert looks at Bill and asks him how he’d like to win the lottery.
	As it happens there’s a lottery draw the next week. Not a large one, but large enough that Bill will be a millionaire when he wins. Albert tells him which numbers to pick, and Bill picks them, shaking his head. Bill tries to imagine what his life will be like if Albert is right about the numbers. The money will be the smallest change; the notion that for years he’s been friends with a guy possessed of a power that could change the world is amazing. Bill asks Albert why he hasn’t won the lottery for himself, and Albert tells him that he wasn’t old enough before just recently, and anyways lottery winnings like this one are chump change. Albert has been investing in the stock market since he was ten. As he finishes buying the ticket with the desired numbers, Bill realizes something and looks sharply at Albert and asks him who would have won had the two of them not interfered. Albert shrugs dismissively and says it doesn’t matter, because to Albert it simply doesn’t. He could have sent the information back before, but now that they’ve bought the winning ticket that future no longer exists. The current future is one in which Bill wins the lottery, and whoever would have won it in the other future now doesn’t. Albert doesn’t care that he just messed with a person’s life, and Bill suddenly understands that it’s because he’s done it before. A certain math teacher has already felt the full brunt of Albert’s nonchalance when it comes to messing with time. Bill shakes his head and reminds himself that he’s taking Albert’s story too seriously. What are the odds that Albert is telling the truth and that he’s right about the lottery numbers?
	A week later the odds are revealed to be one hundred percent because Bill is both a lottery winner and a millionaire. When the numbers are read aloud on television Bill sinks to the floor and just sits on the ground in a shocked slump. Albert, who is standing nearby having come over to witness the reading of the numbers doesn’t say I told you so, but just shrugs again when Bill looks at him. The two boys, now men at the age of eighteen, hand in the lottery ticket and retrieve Bill’s money. Bill gives half of it to charity and the other half to his parents, who are amazed at how lucky their son is. They themselves never buy lottery tickets, although nobody can argue with a one hundred percent win rate. They tell their son over and over again that he’s incredibly lucky, and Bill just shakes his head wordlessly, feeling numb. Luck had stopped having a say in his life from the moment he met Albert, Bill sees for the first time. Albert, and by extension everyone who’s life he touches, are immune to things like luck and fate. Albert’s power supersedes them.`,

      "storypartial" : `Now that Bill knows about Albert’s ability, he better understands why Albert has made him his unofficial representative to the outside world. Albert barely understands Bill, and has absolutely no idea what other people are like. Albert only understands himself, having spent so many years speaking to his other selves instead of to other people. Although Albert never outright says it, Bill gets the idea that to Albert everybody who isn’t like him, meaning possessed of the godlike power to be outside of time, is like Bill. Albert knows best how to deal with all the other Alberts, which to Albert’s mind means that Bill knows best how to deal with all the other Bills. Albert’s logic, if based on a false pretence, is more or less correct in that Bill understands regular people far and away better than Albert does.
	After high school, Albert and Bill both go to the same university. Bill could have gone pretty much anywhere as his grades were quite high, and Albert really could have gone anywhere considering his perfect scores, but they both end up going to the state university. They are in their second year when Albert asks Bill how he’d like to be vice president. Bill knows that Albert isn’t talking about student vice president anymore, and realizes that Albert must have been aiming for this for years. All the stepping stones lead to the white house. Albert wants to fulfill the dreams of all the Alberts and make his position reflect his ability. Bill just shrugs and goes along with it. Being vice president of America would be a pretty good job; he could make his parents proud. Bill asks what party they’re going to join and Albert says neither: they’ll be independent. Bill asks how they’re going to afford an entire election campaign without any funding from a political party and Albert doesn’t even reply; just shows Bill his bank balance. Bill whistles through his teeth at the amount of zeroes before the decimal place. Albert’s been busy.
	Like before, Bill becomes the vice president on what for him is his first attempt. It is the first time since the inception of the dual party system that an independent ticket takes the white house. Albert on the other hand had to run the campaign two hundred and thirty five times before he finally won. Albert’s mind holds over two hundred years of memories, most of which are memories of different versions of the same year; the campaign year. Truthfully it is Bill who really wins them the election. Bill comes up with ideas and strategies; Albert just tells him whether or not they already tried them in a different version of the time stream. Bill is the brain of the operation; Albert is the mind. Bill is in charge of ideas; Albert is in charge of memories. Together they are formidable.
	Albert and Bill are only thirty-five years old when they become president and vice president of the United States. Albert has spent most of the previous decade training in kick boxing, which Bill knows he will use to save him from the bullies all those years ago. Bill is actually quite good at running the country; he makes good decisions and knows how to get things done. Albert is a natural leader, charismatic and wise beyond his physical age of thirty due to his mental age of somewhere in the vicinity of two hundred and sixty. It helps that there is always a future version of not just Albert but also Bill to help guide them. Now that Bill knows what Albert can do, he often uses Albert to send messages to his past self. Their system prevents terrorists from succeeding, wars from happening, and disasters from catching people unawares.
	Bill and Albert are so successful in fact that they achieve a second term in office without having to go back in time even once to win the election. Their approval ratings and deeds win the election for them. Bill gets married and has kids, getting all he wants out of life. Albert is the best man at his wedding, and is perfectly sociable. Bill wonders if he had to use his ability to correct any egregious mistakes, but he doesn’t ask as he doesn’t really want to know. Bill names Albert as the godfather of his children.`,

      "storypartial" : `Unfortunately Albert is as unhappy as Bill is happy, and the worst part is that he doesn’t know why. Albert is insanely wealthy, a successful president, and has the love of his nation all at the physical age of just thirty eight. He is physically fit, and a great kick boxer. He has tried to follow in Bill’s footsteps, to find a wife and settle down, but every time he meets somebody a future version of himself tells him it doesn’t work out. This has happened too many times to count, and Albert begins to believe that he simply can’t have a relationship with anybody anymore. He is simply too different now, all the things that make a person human have been lost to him in exchange for the centuries of memories he now possesses; memories of years that didn’t happen. Albert has never felt the need for companionship as there have always been infinite different Alberts for him to talk to, but he finds himself feeling lonely even with himself for company.
	Albert tries spending time with Bill but it only makes him feel more depressed. Bill is busy with his wife and kids, and although he always makes time for Albert something has changed between them. Bill has other friends now, acquaintances from his political years. Albert will always be his best friend but now Bill has a family to spend time with. Albert stops visiting Bill’s house as often when he realizes the expression of Bill’s face whenever he stops by is pity. Bill knows Albert too well; he knows that Albert isn’t happy. Bill understands that just knowing things isn’t enough, that’s not a life. Bill is sorry for his friend, but it’s out of his hands now, if it ever was. If something is wrong with Albert then the only person who can fix it is Albert himself.
	So once again Albert finds himself alone with only himself to talk to, just as he was before he saved Bill. Unlike that time all those years ago however, Albert finds talking to himself to be dry and not enjoyable. The past Alberts look to the future with hope and the dreams of what they hope to accomplish. The future Alberts look to the past with longing and nostalgia, a pattern the present Albert has already begun to slide in to. Talking to either set of Alberts depresses him so he doesn’t do it, instead spending his days totally alone for the first time in his life. Never before has he been alone the way anyone else in his position would be alone, and he takes a perverse pleasure in it. He knows himself well, better than anyone else might know themselves, so he knows that in some way he is punishing himself, although the reason for it escapes him. He thinks perhaps it is atonement for Cindy, or the math teacher, or even those bullies he beat up the day he met Bill. Albert reads books, and even writes a few. He watches television, but he finds he can’t relate to the characters on the shows, ditto for movies. He realizes that everyone else must find him as alien to them as he finds them to him, and this also depresses him. The worst part is that there’s nobody to talk to. Bill would listen but Albert doesn’t want to trouble him with his problems. Nobody other than Bill knew about his ability, the one that had made all his dreams come true and then damned him to solitude, and even Bill wouldn’t truly understand. Bill knows, but unlike Albert he doesn’t know. Albert knows that he has become a victim of his own success, or more accurately a victim of the very thing that made him successful. He finds it ironic that he used his ability for everything when he was younger, never realizing how with every message he sent to his past self he was destroying his ability for empathy. Albert has never failed and never made a mistake, but now that it’s too late he realizes that everything he has ever done has been a series of mistakes that led up to this most enormous of failures. Like the rest of his life it is a paradox.
	Then Albert realizes that perhaps it is not too late. For him, Albert thinks, there is no such thing as ‘too late’. He can go back and fix this, change the events of his life so that he doesn’t end up old, alone, and unable to even have a conversation with anyone other than Bill, the only person who knows enough to understand him.`,

      "storypartial" : `So he goes back. Sending a message explaining everything is impossible, even if his younger self believed it—which Albert knew he wouldn’t—he wouldn’t be able to fix it without the full complement of memories he now possessed. The younger Alberts wouldn’t believe that even once they had everything they wouldn’t be happy. The younger Alberts held on to the dream of finally achieving peaceful contentment because it was the only reason they had for continuing. It was the light at the end of the tunnel and they would never believe it didn’t exist. Which left the option of sending himself backwards, but how far to go back? How long ago did his life start to become meaningless? Albert decided to go back to that moment when he first asked Bill to be the vice president on his ballot.
	Albert went back to that moment many times, becoming a business magnate, an oil tycoon, a Wall Street stock trader, a farmer, an astronaut, a physicist, a doctor, and an uncountable number of other occupations, none of which make him any happier than being president had. Bill on the other hand always ends up happy, finding a wife—albeit often a different wife than in the other time streams—and has kids, settling into the same routine as in all the other time streams. Albert never tells Bill about the other time streams, he knows that Bill will be happier not knowing. Albert has four hundred years of memories by the time he decides that he had already been doomed by the time he went to university.
	So he goes back even farther to the moment he meets Bill. This time he doesn’t save the boy, even though he knows it to be a small minded decision born from the jealousy he feels towards the man the boy would become. He walks right by Bill and his three bullies, leaving him to Fate, the fickle mistress that owned everyone except for Albert. Not only does this not make Albert happy, it actually speeds up the depression. He doesn’t realize how much he relies on Bill’s presence until it’s no longer there. Albert has only moved the loneliness forwards in time, from his late thirties all the way up to high school. Albert takes his hundreds of years of memories and travels even further backwards.
	He goes back to that math test in third grade, this time with multiple lifetimes worth of memories in his head, enough to easily pass a third grade math without needing help from his future selves. Albert lives his entire life over again but it is the same as before, if not even worse. Albert is edging closer and closer to five hundred years old and everyone around him is in their teens. He can barely keep the memories straight now; they’re so jumbled and chaotic. His head feels like there’s a riot going on inside it. He makes it as far as the moment when Cindy is supposed to ask him out, and he stands around waiting for her after the debate but she never shows up. This version of Albert was so alien to his peers that she doesn’t even want him anymore. Albert falls to his knees, the knees of a tenth grader, and holds his head in his hands as the memories of a five hundred year old man blend and swirl together. Bill asks him what’s wrong, standing by his side once more as Albert has saved him in this time stream, and Albert just looks up into Bill’s concerned face and screams. Bill recoils, surprised not just by the sound but by the look of horror that contorts Albert’s face. Albert, who has never to Bill’s knowledge even been surprised, is now screaming and screaming and won’t stop screaming and Bill doesn’t know why. They won the debate; Albert is getting perfect on his tests, what could scare him so badly about that?
	Albert just keeps screaming, aware that for the first time he has failed and cannot fix it simply by going backwards. He has gazed too long into the abyss and now the abyss has made itself comfortable in his mind. He tried to fix everything with his ability, unaware that the more he fixed his life the more he destroyed it. Now he can’t take it back, he can’t retrieve it, he has overwritten his entire life to the point that all the past and future Alberts possess the same hundreds of years of memories that he does. Even if he uses one of them to erase this version of himself from existence, the version that erased him will be just as doomed. There is no longer an original Albert. Albert is screaming because he realizes the only option left to him is to break down the final wall, the one limit he hasn’t yet overcome, the one line he hasn’t yet crossed. There is a period of time in his life that he has never been to, a time when he didn’t have the ability to transcend the forward current of the time stream, the part of his life that preceded that third grade math test. Albert concentrates on smashing down that last barrier, aware that if he fails here there will be no recourse, no escape left to him. It is all or nothing to stop himself from, in the very act of not making any mistakes, end up making the biggest mistake of his life.
	Albert goes back as far as he can, to his first memory. Albert’s body is four years old, and when his mind that measures its lifespan in centuries collides with his four year old brain both of them short circuit. Albert has brought his ability to a time before it existed, and he has brought memories to a brain that cannot handle them. Albert the four year old gives a piercing cry that chills his parents to the core and faints as Albert the five hundred year old screams internally, a deranged shriek that nobody will ever hear.`,

      "storypartial" : `Albert doesn’t return to consciousness immediately, and his faint becomes a coma. Nobody knows what happened; the doctors are as puzzled as his parents. They don’t even know whether Albert is still conscious or not. Albert’s parents, in the darkest parts of their minds, have an unspoken fear that Albert might be trapped in an unresponsive body, conscious of every waking moment and being slowly driven insane by the darkness that he cannot banish. In truth, although they do not know it, Albert was driven insane long ago in the distant future. Albert is not conscious in his comatose body, his mind having been nearly obliterated by the arrival of the Albert from a time stream that will now never exist. His parents are sad, thinking that their child will never get to have a life, not knowing that Albert has already lived more lives than anyone else ever to live. In fact, Albert might have been happy to know what would happen to him if he did the unthinkable. Albert, after having lived for hundreds of the same years, was tired. He was tired of the same things happening over and over, tired of the lethargy of going through the motions. To Albert’s overworked mind, being comatose might have looked like a long sleep after a long day that stretched far too long. It is the end of Albert’s story, and like all the other events in his lifetimes Albert would have seen it differently than everyone else. To a normal person this is a sad ending, but to Albert this is the peaceful contentment he was always looking for; a break from the constant turmoil of going back and forth through time. In the end, Albert only achieved a semblance of happiness by destroying the gift he had so fervently asked for. The memories that had tormented him lost forever, the time streams that had cursed him forgotten.
	It’s a new Albert that wakes up two months later and looks around in puzzlement. The doctors and nurses rush into the room and swiftly deem the entire event to be beyond explanation. His parents are crying and smiling and filled with joy, and Albert also starts to cry. For some reason he feels incredibly happy, like an infinitely heavy weight has been lifted from his shoulders. Of course, he can’t put it into those terms. How could he? Albert is only four years old.`,

      "storypartial" : `Cletus pulled his truck over to the side of the road. Or more accurately, Cletus’ truck drifted into the ditch of its own accord as both its driver and passenger sat slack-jawed in awestruck silence at the strangest thing either man had ever seen.
	“What the hell is that?” asked Tucker, the aforementioned passenger, looking up at Cletus since the passenger’s side of the truck was now noticeably lower than the driver’s side, their being in the ditch and all. Cletus didn’t even bother to make any noise acknowledging the question. Instead he opened the door and started to walk across the road to where his eyes insisted the thing was. Tucker, shrugging his massive shoulders, followed suit. Between the two, Cletus was definitely the brains of the operation, which was a sad state of affairs for all involved. Tucker more than made up for Cletus’ mental shortcomings by his prodigious strength however, and between the two of them they had the strength of five men and the brains of one and a half.
	“Hoooooly shit,” breathed Cletus once he was within a few feet of the thing, “I think this is one of them flying saucer thingies.”
	“You mean it has aliens inside it?” Tucker asked the question with something like awe in his voice. “I saw a document on the Discovery Channel ‘bout UFO’s and aliens and stuff.”
	“A documentary,” corrected Cletus absently. “I wonder if it’s gonna open by itself or if there’s like, some sort of doorbell or something.”
	“Yeah, that’s it, a documentally,” agreed Tucker. “Are you sure we should stick around though? What if it doesn’t come in peace?”
	“Well then all the more reason we should be here to defend the free world!” shouted Cletus wildly. “It falls to us red blooded American patriots to… to… Sweet Jesus, I think something’s coming out!”

Cletus, while not necessarily right about many things in which he believed but could not see, had very good eyes and was definitely right about most things he could see, including the fact that a ramp was lowering out of the side of the flying saucer. At the top, silhouetted by the background light of the interior of the saucer—which was so intense as to be almost blinding even in the midday sun of Texas—strolled casually down the ramp and stood in front of the two human onlookers.
	Anyone who saw the three gathered there, standing in a triangle so that each could easily see the other two, would have been hard pressed to find a stranger group of people even if one didn’t take the fact that the triangle’s third point was comprised of an alien. Cletus was so tall and skinny that he was best described as a stick person. His skinniness made him look taller and his tallness made him look skinnier. In summary, Cletus was just a shade under six feet tall and weighed somewhere around a hundred and forty pounds, due to a rigorous intake of cigarettes and methamphetamine. Tucker, by comparison, looked like a bull. Tucker was even taller than Cletus, although the odd optical illusion produced by Cletus’ emaciated frame tended to make the observer believe them closer in height to each other than they really were. Tucker was six-three, over three hundred pounds of the type of pure muscle only achievable by those who ritually abuse anabolic steroids. In stark contrast to both of these prime specimens of humanity stood the alien, who was at most four and a half feet tall, grey of complexion, completely hairless, and somehow devoid of a face. It had a head, but where there would have been eyes, a nose, ears and a mouth there was just perfectly smooth grey skin, unmarred by even the most minute of disruptions.
	The three stood facing each other, the oddest trio on planet Earth, as if in a Mexican standoff. The analogy was fitting, since both Cletus and Tucker were armed, and nobody knew what type of incredible heat the alien was packing under its loose fitting clothes, which were of a material that Cletus couldn’t even begin to describe but that Tucker later said was, ‘the opposite of shiny.’`,

      "storypartial" : `“Do you uh, do you want to see our leader or something?” asked Tucker finally when the stress of silence became too much for him to bear. Cletus sighed but didn’t say anything about it, he’d learned long ago to let Tucker deal with things in his own way, and it wasn’t the first time Tucker had ruined an otherwise perfect moment.
	“Beep,” said the alien, and Cletus’ eyes almost popped out of his head. Tucker, amazingly, seemed to have expected that exact response judging by the calmness of his expression, but Cletus had never come closer to breaking down in hysterics than he had at that moment. How in the hell the alien had managed to beep was totally beyond him, but Cletus couldn’t help imagining that under the clothes the alien was farting out beeps as a mode of communication. Cletus felt the laughter rising up inside him, and was forced to nearly strangle himself to keep it at bay. He sternly reminded himself that he was the ambassador of the world, nay of America itself, and that he shouldn’t start laughing like an insane person. “Beep,” said the alien again, in a tone of voice that communicated insistence, although on what it was insisting Tucker had no idea. All he knew was that the alien apparently only had one noise, and that beside him Tucker was trying with partial success to stop himself from exploding into crazed guffaws, tears streaming down his face as he attempted to keep his mouth shut by way of his hands.
	“Well uh, I guess we can take you to see the governor. Maybe he’ll be able to call the president or something. Hell, I’m no good in these diploma situations, I never even got my high school diploma,” explained Tucker, completely seriously. Tucker’s imperfect grasp of English was usually a minor inconvenience to Cletus, who corrected him almost without thinking, but this time it was almost too much to bear, and when the alien beeped for a third time and followed Tucker to the truck, which was half in and half out of the ditch, Cletus finally gave up and started to just scream laughter. In a moment he was sitting in the dirt by the side of a little used Texan freeway, next to a UFO, crying with laughter while an alien and his best friend looked on from the other side of the road. The alien made a concerned sounding beep which perfectly mirrored the reflection on Tucker’s face, but Cletus couldn’t hear the alien over the sound of his own laughter or see Tucker’s face through the tears.

	Cletus eventually managed to collect himself enough to drive, although every few minutes the giggles threatened to breach the blockade he’d imposed upon them. Cletus drove in the general direction of Austin with Tucker in his customary spot in the passenger’s seat and the alien sitting in the middle of the back seat. Every time Cletus glanced in the rear view mirror and saw that non-face he had to work to stop himself from bellowing laughter again. Eventually he decided that for the safety of Tucker, himself, and the alien he wouldn’t use the rear view mirror at all. It wasn’t that big a deal, since Cletus had never bothered much with it in the first place. As Cletus’ truck barrelled down the freeway at a hundred and twenty miles an hour, Cletus was distracted from his internal monologue in which he was trying to impress upon himself the incredible seriousness of his quest.
“Cletus,” said Tucker, nudging his shoulder with one meaty paw, “Cletus, hey, Cletus…”
	“CLETUS, PULL THAT DAMN TRUCK OF YOURS OVER RIGHT NOW, YOU HEAR?”
	“He’s had his sirens on for at least five minutes following us,” provided Tucker unhelpfully, “He’s probably pretty angry.” Cletus looked at Tucker, who appeared slightly worried by the prospect of their being arrested but not overly so, looked in the rear view mirror to see the alien’s lack of a face by which it could have communicated any sort of feeling, and in the side mirror, where a very angry Officer Fleming was stomping over to Cletus’ truck, which he had pulled over to the side of the road.
	“What seems to be the problem, Officer?” asked Cletus sarcastically as Officer Fleming’s beet red face appeared in his window.`,

	“They mean the speed limit’s sixty Officer,” provided Tucker, again very unhelpfully.
	“That’s right Tucker, that’s exactly what they mean. Now tell me, how fast were you going?”
	“You’re the one with the fancy radar gun, why don’t you tell us?” replied Cletus before Tucker could make any more of an ass out of himself, because although Cletus highly doubted such a thing was possible, he would have also described his meeting an alien in similar terms only yesterday.
	“A hundred and twenty em-pee-ayche,” sighed Officer Fleming, tasting the words on his tongue as if they were a fine wine of the most luxuriant vintage. “I think I might get to impound your truck this time Cletus old buddy.” The officer paused, looking up from his notebook and squinting into the back window of the truck. “Who’ve you got in the back there? I didn’t know Dumb and Dumber came with a side of Dumbest.” Officer Fleming said this with a perfectly straight face, and then when he realized he’d made a joke he cracked up and laughed to himself, rather obnoxiously in Cletus’ opinion. It was especially annoying since Fleming was only marginally smarter than Tucker, but of course to say that to his face was to invite upon himself a special dose of police brutality.
	“That reminds me, we never did get your name,” said Cletus offhandedly to the alien in the back seat, while outside the truck Fleming’s loud barking noises continued.
	“Beep,” responded the alien, predictably. It appeared to know when it was being spoken to at least, since it had remained silent until Cletus specifically asked it a question.
	“He says his name is Beep officer,” relayed Cletus to the officer with a smile.
	“Beep, eh? You getting smart with me boy?” Fleming had composed himself again, and was back to being angry with Cletus, just hoping for an excuse to do something. He’d occasionally fantasized about what it would be like to taze Cletus, watch his bony frame bounce on the ground in the current of electric shock.
	“No sir, you asked for his name and I told it to you,” pointed out Cletus unwisely. He must have literally gotten too smart for Officer Fleming, because the officer immediately ordered everyone out of the truck, including Beep, who either understood the command or was simply mimicking Tucker and Cletus. Cletus, to his own surprise, sincerely believed it was the former, although why he didn’t know. Something about the way it acted made it seem as if it perfectly understood everything that was said to it, although how it could possibly hear without ears Cletus didn’t even bother to consider.`,

      "storypartial" : `Once they were all out of the truck and standing in a line before the officer, who by the looks of his face appeared to have blood pressure problems, Officer Fleming began to pace up and down in front of them. He’d walked the length of the three of them four times, from Beep on one side past Cletus in the middle to Tucker at the other end and back again before he came to a stop in front of Beep, looking the little grey alien over and scratching his head beneath his wide brimmed hat.
	“What did you say your name was?”
	“Beep.”
	“Right, and where are you from?”
	“Beep.” Luckily Cletus had mostly exhausted his hysterics earlier, because when Fleming turned to him the look on his face was murderous.
	“Do you think this is funny Cletus? Is this your idea of a joke?”
	“I’d like to have my lawyer present before I answer that question officer,” was Cletus’ reply as he stared straight ahead, unblinking even in the early afternoon sun. Fleming, who hadn’t expected an answer, had already turned back to try and figure out how Beep could just not have a face. At the sound of Cletus’ voice, he turned back and calmly sauntered over to stand in front of him, and almost as an afterthought sucker punched Cletus in the gut. While the skinny man was doubled over gasping for breath, the cop glared up at Tucker, and in a rather redundant way verbally dared him to say something.
	“You got something to say there Tuck? Go ahead, say it, I dare you.”
	“I don’t think you’re allowed to hit people. Isn’t that police brutality?” Cletus, still bent over and clutching his stomach as if checking his internal organs for damage, looked up at his mammoth friend with something close to admiration. Not because he had said something, but mostly because he’d actually gotten it right.
	Fleming looked up at Tucker and made a judgment call. Unfortunately for him, he had been educated in the manner of small town cops and highway patrolmen, and so he made the wrong decision. Fleming wasn’t used to having his authority questioned, and he relished power in the way of small minds everywhere. The thing was, Fleming didn’t consider himself an upholder of the law, in Fleming’s tiny mind he was the law, and that meant he felt himself not only justified but morally obligated to dish out punishment as he saw fit. The fact that there was almost no oversight on police officers like him is a travesty that seems never to be addressed, but the main point here—in case it wasn’t already clear—was that Fleming was almost always the dumbest person in whatever room he happened to be in at the time, even if he wasn’t inside. All of which is to say that he decided to punch Tucker the same way he had punched Cletus, and he truly expected a similar result. Anybody with multiple brain cells might have decided differently, but whatever his reasoning, Fleming wound up and slammed his fist into Tucker’s midriff.
	It was like punching steel. In a flash of pain, Fleming recoiled from Tucker, who was completely unmoved. Indeed it appeared as though he hadn’t even felt the blow, probably because he hadn’t. Fleming was good at punching despite the frequency with which he practiced his techniques on powerless victims. When Fleming’s fist met Tucker’s abdominal wall something had to give, and that something was Fleming’s wrist, which gave spectacularly and with such pain that it brought tears to Fleming’s eyes behind his aviator sunglasses.
	“That wasn’t smart,” reflected Tucker as he looked down at Fleming, who was cradling his sprained wrist in his hand and grunting. Cletus had never liked Tucker more than in that one moment, but if he kept it up somebody was going to die. Fleming whipped off his sunglasses and in the same fluid motion rammed the barrel of his gun into Tucker’s ribcage. The giant looked at it with a look of such perfect disinterest that he looked to Cletus almost like what he imagined a martyr would look like before they were burned at the stake.
	“What the fuck did you say to me boy?” hissed Fleming, grinding his gun into Tucker’s shirt. Tucker looked like he was probably going to yawn, and Cletus was about to interrupt when somebody else spoke up.
	“Beep,” said Beep, and Cletus thought he heard a note of warning in that single syllable, but he was too preoccupied to pay much attention to the alien at the moment, he was too caught up in the drama unfolding between Fleming, who looked more like a murderous psychopath with every passing moment, and Tucker, who looked like he might fall asleep if Fleming didn’t shoot him first.
	“Don’t think I’ve forgotten about you, you little grey son of a bitch,” said Fleming without looking away from Tucker, “or you Cletus you grimy motherfucker.”
	“Beep.”`,

      "storypartial" : `Since both Fleming and Cletus were both concentrating intently on Tucker, the big man was the only one who actually witnessed what happened next. He had looked over to the alien at the second beep, and his eyes widened in comical surprise. Considering how bored Tucker had looked even when being prodded by a loaded gun held by a homicidal maniac, both Cletus and Tucker had started to turn around to see what he was looking at. What they saw was Beep, who had stepped out of line and was pointing something at Fleming. All assembled knew instantly what it was, it was impossible not to know what that thing was unless you’d been living under a rock for your whole life. As Fleming stared down the barrel of the last thing he would ever see, his final act on Earth was to shit his pants.
	Even as Fleming’s bowels were evacuating themselves into his uniform, Beep fired what was so obviously a ray gun that when it fired an energy ray straight into Fleming’s chest Cletus was almost disappointed. The effect that the ray had on Fleming swiftly banished such thoughts however, as the erstwhile highway patrolman exploded. It was the most terrifying and poetic thing Cletus had ever seen in his life. Tucker disagreed, having seen what happened right before that moment. He maintained that when he saw Beep step forward, turn ninety degrees, and whip out the death ray so fast his arm was a blur and the weapon just appeared in his hand, that he had almost beat Fleming to becoming a member of the exclusive club of men who shit their pants.
	So when the gore settled, three figures stood where only moments ago there had been four. Beep had replaced the ray gun wherever he had pulled it from with the same preternatural speed with which he had drawn it, and Cletus and Tucker were both standing still with their mouths wide open in shock for the second time that day. Tucker was looking at Beep and still trying to understand how anything could possibly move that fast. Cletus was looking down at the disgusting puddle of residue that had once been Fleming and trying to decide if he should throw up or run away. Fleming’s uniform had survived the death ray better than its occupant had, although that wasn’t to say it had done well. What had once been a pristine set of clothes that had been starched and ironed every day was now a smoldering mess, still smoking in the areas that weren’t soaking in Fleming’s bodily fluids, which were alternately the dark red of blood or the dark brown of feces. Even the gun that he had held was a melted pile of shapeless metal, into which flowed the similarly molten alloy of what used to be Fleming’s watch.
	“Well, I guess that’s that then,” said Cletus after eventually deciding that even though he wouldn’t wish that fate on his worst enemy (who was until that moment Fleming) there was nothing he could do about it now. He ushered Beep into the backseat of the truck, and when Tucker had collected himself enough to get in the passenger’s seat, the three of them resumed their journey.

	It was getting late, and the trio was still fairly far away from Austin. Texas, in case anyone in the world remains unaware, is a big place. Cletus pulled off the highway into a small town, and booked three rooms for them. As he swiped his credit card, he wondered at how easily he was going along with the crazy plan. Although plan was the wrong word wasn’t it? He was just winging it. He and Tucker were just going with the flow, taking the alien to the governor’s house. That was another thing; Cletus had no idea where the governor lived. Should he take Beep to the governor’s house or was there some sort of office where he worked?
	Cletus went back out to the parking lot where Tucker and Beep were waiting, and they followed him back into the motel. The receptionist looked at Beep with an expression on her face that was part horrified curiosity and part curious horror. Cletus supposed that was probably what he should have felt as well upon seeing a creature with no face, but oddly he had no problem with it.
	Once he’d ushered Beep into his room and directed Tucker to his own, Cletus went to the room he’d booked for himself and flopped onto the bed. His bank account had taken a hit on the motel rooms, but he probably had enough money to see the strange adventure through to its conclusion. It felt kind of strange to be thinking of money so soon after seeing Fleming shit himself and then explode, but again Cletus found he didn’t care very much.
	It wasn’t that Fleming was an idiotic mean spirited jackass either. Ever since he had first laid eyes on Beep everything he used to be concerned with seemed less important somehow. He probably wouldn’t have had a much larger reaction if he hadn’t known the cop that had pulled them over, although that wasn’t likely since Cletus had met every cop and patrolman in the area at one time or another, mostly for things like petty larceny and narcotics. Speaking of narcotics, he hadn’t shot up in a while, although that predated Beep’s arrival. Methamphetamine just didn’t do it for him anymore. Cletus chuckled softly to himself and shook his head, wondering if he’d replaced drugs with this harebrained scheme to take Beep to the governor.
	And speaking of wondering, Cletus wondered what would happen when he and Tucker finally got Beep wherever he wanted to go, if indeed his beeps had meant he wanted to visit the governor at all. Despite all of the movies he had seen where an alien wanted the locals to ‘take me to your leader’ he wasn’t at all sure that was how it worked in real life. Something about Beep made you think you understood what he wanted, but that could easily be an illusion on his part.
	Cletus kicked off his boots, lay back on the bed, and closed his eyes. Beep seemed to understand what was happening, he—was it a he?—had definitely understood what a gun was when Fleming had drawn it on Tucker. Tucker had seemed different that day as well, any other day Cletus wouldn’t have been surprised if Tucker flipped out on Fleming for doing what he did, but instead he had been calm and collected, even more so than Cletus himself, an odd reversal of their usual roles. Maybe the alien was having as large an effect on Tucker as he was on Cletus. Cletus got up and showered, pulled his boxers back on and turned off the lights. It was hotter than hellfire in the hotel room, so he opened the window and threw the blankets and sheets to the floor.
	As he relaxed and closed his eyes once more, his mind turned to Beep, the mysterious little grey figure who was his charge. He tried to imagine where Beep had come from, but all that rose to his mind was a jumble of science fiction and western images. Beep definitely had advanced technology, but that evidently didn’t mean he came from a peaceful society, since Tucker swore up and down he was the fastest quick draw he’d ever seen. Tucker went to the range a lot, and participated in that type of thing, so Cletus believed him. What did that mean though? For that matter, why was Beep even on Earth in the first place? It seemed pretty farfetched that he could be there for diplomatic reasons or to open a line of communication; he only had one word. That was definitely the weirdest part of the whole thing too. Cletus could get over the fact that Beep didn’t have a face, that Beep’s technology made no sense, that he seemed way too relaxed about being driven to an unknown place, but how in the world could a technologically advanced society have a language with only one word? Even if you took into account the different intonation and intensity, there was a limit on how effectively you could communicate with a single word.
	Cletus sighed, and in spite of himself he smiled. His mother had always warned him about looking a gift horse in the mouth, and here he was trying to stick his head down its throat. Beep was probably the greatest thing that had happened or would ever happen to him. Who cared if he only knew one word? Beep was something exciting, something new. In a lifetime of dabbling with drugs and alcohol, committing crimes and drinking and whoring and gambling, he’d never found himself particularly interested in anything until now. In the face of such an incredible event, Cletus found that even the possibility that Fleming’s death might be traced back to them somehow immaterial. Fuck Fleming anyway, he thought to himself, the guy was an asshole. And on that note, Cletus fell asleep.`,

      "storypartial" : `In the morning, Cletus woke up and went across the hall to knock on Tucker’s door. Tucker was yawning and stretching and generally looked like he wanted to sleep for another ten hours, but Cletus was far too excited to sit still any longer. He wanted to get on the road as soon as possible so they could make it to Austin that afternoon. Cletus impatiently waited for Tucker to get dressed, and noted the dishevelled look of his friend. Looking in the mirror, he found that he looked even worse, and that his clothes were covered in dust and dirt.
	“Tucker, how much money ya got?”
	“Like three or four hundred bucks, why?”
	“I think we need some new duds. We’re gonna meet the governor man, we can’t show up looking like this.” Cletus tried to wipe some of the dust off of his pants, but only succeeded in smearing it around. He frowned at the smudge and then looked back up at his friend. “Let’s go get ourselves spiffed up; I think we passed a clothes store on the way into town.”
	Tucker yawned and shrugged, and the two of them walked over to Beep’s room, and knocked. There was silence from behind the door, and Cletus was about to open the door when he remembered that he’d given Beep the key card the previous night. He was just about to suggest that they go downstairs and ask for another key when the door opened and Beep was standing in front of them with one towel around his waist and another around his head, despite the fact that he was totally bald. Cletus noticed that Beep didn’t have nipples, or toes. It was the first time they’d seen him without his weird jumpsuit on. Cletus looked down at Beep’s feet, which were really just pods, up at his faceless head, and then at the towel around his waist. A part of him wanted to see what was under there, but he figured he was better off not knowing.
	“Come on Beep, we’re going to go buy some new clothes. Do you, uh, want new clothes?” Cletus stammered, once again unsure if Beep understood. It made absolutely no sense that an alien should speak English after less than twenty four hours on Earth, but apparently Beep understood, as he beeped what sounded like an affirmative. The door closed and Cletus and Tucker spent a few minutes discussing exactly how Beep had managed to figure out the shower before Beep reappeared in his jumpsuit, which really did look a little worse for the wear.
Near the highway at the edge of town there was a men’s clothing store, where Cletus and Tucker bought themselves some new clothes. Since Cletus had paid for the motel rooms, Tucker shelled out some money for Beep to get a few things. The salesman absolutely refused to acknowledge anything remotely different about Beep, and treated him with the same detached disdain with which he treated all of his customers. So after trying on their purchases they dressed in the change rooms and laden down with bags the three of them returned to Cletus’ truck.
	Tucker, who always had fewer options than most people because of his prodigious size, had bought a couple of pairs of jeans and some plain white T-shirts. Cletus was dressed in shorts and similar white shirts, although in a smaller size. Cletus’ lanky frame meant he had to buy clothes that were too wide for him in order to get the right length, which only further amplified the strange illusion of his being taller than he actually was. Beep, for some unknowable reason, had bought a formal looking suit despite the oppressive heat. He appeared to be perfectly comfortable in it though, and beeped happily as he climbed into the backseat of the truck. Once everyone was settled and buckled in Cletus started the truck and after a small detour to fill up on gas the journey to Austin to find the governor resumed.
It was around lunchtime that Cletus realized they hadn’t eaten since lunch the previous day. In the excitement surrounding their encounter with Officer Fleming he’d completely forgotten about it, although he probably couldn’t have eaten so soon after seeing and smelling Fleming’s untimely demise.
	“Beep, do you eat food or drink water or something?”
	“Beep.”
	“Right. So then what do you do?”
	“Beep.”
	“Well that explains it,” said Cletus sarcastically. “Well, we need to stop to eat, so we’re going to go find a restaurant, ok?”
	“Beep.”`,

      "storypartial" : `Beep went with Cletus and Tucker into the diner, and while he seemed interested in the food—at least that’s how it seemed to Cletus; it was hard to read an expression in a face that wasn’t there—he didn’t eat anything. The method by which Beep sustained himself was simply one more mystery added on to the thousand others concerning the strange alien.
	They made it to Austin around four that afternoon. Cletus and Tucker were both more rural than urban, and every time they ventured into one of the big cities they realized anew how massive they were. Following a few slightly contradictory directions from local pedestrians, they eventually found city hall.
	“We’re here to see the governor,” Cletus told the woman at the front desk. The place looked very official and bureaucratic, at least in Cletus’ eyes. He’d never been much for government. In fact, unlike Tucker he’d never even voted before, it was one of the ways in which the big man was more cultured than he was. Not that Tucker had ever voted for either of the two big parties, he always threw his vote away on whatever party had caught his interest that year, sometimes it was the Libertarians, once it had actually been the local Communist party, although Tucker hadn’t explained that particular choice and probably never would.
	“Uh-huh. Do you have an appointment?” asked the front desk woman without looking up from the computer screen in front of her.
	“No, but I think he’ll see us,” explained Cletus. “We brought an alien with us.”
	“Yeah, that’s not how that works,” stated the woman whose name was—at least according to her nametag—Mary, without looking up at Cletus or making any other gesture to acknowledge his presence. “You have to book an appointment months in advance; the governor doesn’t just see anyone who walks in off the street whenever they want. He’s a busy man you know, running the state and all that.”
	“Listen,” said Cletus, a little impressed by the woman’s blasé attitude towards the governor’s job, especially considering she worked in city hall. “We brought an alien, from space. He probably travelled light years to get here, and we’re like eighty percent sure that he wants to see the governor.”
	“Maybe sixty percent, he doesn’t really speak English,” added Tucker, with a sideways glance at Beep, who remained silent and waited patiently for something to happen. Tucker thought about telling Mary that Beep was packing more heat than some of the militaries, but decided she might take that the wrong way.
	“Right,” agreed Cletus. “To be honest, we don’t actually know what he wants, since he only speaks one word, but even if he doesn’t want to see the governor the governor will probably want to see him.”
	“Uh-huh,” said Mary again, finally looking up to see Cletus and Tucker leaning a little bit over the top of the desk, as well as the crown of Beep’s perfectly smooth grey head. She stood up slightly to get a better visual, and was treated to the full sight of the faceless, hairless alien in a suit who had accompanied the two humans into the building. Mary took the sight pretty well; the other people walking around the lobby of the building were doing double and triple takes at the sight of the alien, and some of them had simply stopped walking and were staring open mouthed in shock, much the same way Cletus and Tucker had stared at the spaceship when they had first seen it. Mary leaned over and before Cletus or Tucker could intervene she rubbed her hand on the flat surface where Beep’s face should have been with a dazed look on her own face. Tucker flinched, evidently the memory of Beep’s quick draw technique still fresh in his mind. Cletus leaned forward and laid a hand on Mary’s arm, gently guiding her hand away from Beep before she could molest him any further. For his part Beep took the whole thing rather well, after a minute vibration that encompassed his entire body, he seemed to be allowing the woman to touch him. In any case he didn’t blow her up with the death ray. Once Mary had collected herself she added, “That’s not a mask is it?”
	“Beep,” agreed Beep, sounding exactly as if he understood the question.
	“Well, I’m afraid you boys are in the wrong place. This is where the mayor works, not the governor. I can call and ask if he’s available to see you though.”`,

      "storypartial" : `One phone call later, in which the words ‘alien’ and ‘no I’m not kidding you’ were repeated quite frequently, Cletus, Tucker and Beep were on their way to see the mayor. Cletus marvelled at how the woman had spoken as if the governor was right upstairs when he was evidently somewhere else, but he supposed the mayor was all right as well, and Mary’s eccentricities had probably been borne of working in the public sector.
	At the door, both Cletus and Tucker gave up their firearms to some man in a suit, this one without a name tag. Beep gave up his death ray as well after seeing Cletus and Tucker give up their weapons, although he whipped it out so fast that the man almost fainted. Tucker pointed and mouthed ‘what did I tell you?’ to which Cletus only shrugged.
	They were shown through the door at the other end of the anteroom and found themselves in a large office full of large things. The paintings on the walls were big, the desk was huge, and the man who sat behind it was truly massive. He probably weighed as much as Tucker, although his form was more rotund.
	“So this is the alien,” said the mayor, whose nameplate read Mayor McTexas. Cletus couldn’t believe that there was such a name as ‘McTexas’. He wondered if the man was aiming for the governorship as his name implied. “Take a seat gentlemen and... uh… whatever you are,” he finished awkwardly, waving his hand in Beeps direction. The three of them sat in the three chairs, facing across the desk at Mayor McTexas. Beep’s legs weren’t really long enough to sit comfortably, and his feet swung in the air. “Now,” continued the mayor, “What can I do for you?”
	“Uh,” said Cletus, glancing at Tucker who only shrugged. Cletus had always been the spokesman for their duo before it had become a trio, and evidently he was to continue to fill that position. “Well, we were looking for the governor but we found you instead, so we brought Beep—that’s the name we gave the alien—here hoping maybe you knew what to do. Is there some sort of protocol for this situation?”
	Mayor McTexas leaned back in his chair and folded his hands over his enormous paunch. “If there’s a protocol for aliens I don’t know what it is,” he said, looking at Beep like he was some sort of solvable puzzle. “You said his name was Beep?”
	“Beep,” agreed Beep. Maybe his name really was Beep, Cletus thought to himself.
	“Why don’t you tell me how you and Beep came to be acquainted,” suggested Mayor McTexas.
	“Alright,” said Cletus, instantly making the decision to deliver a slightly abridged version of their tale. “It’s not a very long story really. Tucker and I—” Tucker nodded to say that was him “—were driving along on the highway, minding our own business, when we saw this spaceship, looked just like a UFO from one of those old sci-fi movies. Anyways, we stop and walk over to investigate, and a part of it opens up right? So out comes Beep here—named that because all he does is Beep—and we didn’t really know what to do did we Tucker?” Tucker shook his head in agreement. “So we ask Beep if he wants to be taken to our leader, since that’s what they do in the movies, and Beep just beeps at us, but it seems like he means yes, so we got back in the truck—Beep got in the backseat—and we drove here. He was wearing something else when he came out of the UFO by the way, but it got dirty so we bought him some clothes.”
	“Did you pick them out for him?” asked McTexas, who was supremely fascinated by the alien.
	“Um, no actually, he picked them out himself,” said Cletus. Tucker nodded his head.
	“And this spaceship, or flying saucer or whatever he came in. Is it still there?”
	“I believe so. I mean it was still there when we left.”
	Mayor McTexas had leaned forward so as to better study Beep, but now he once more leaned back in his chair, which complained loudly of his weight with noises of leather rubbing against itself and of wood creaking. “I see,” he said, finally tearing his eyes from Beep’s head and looking down at his desk. “Well then. To be honest, the only aliens I deal with are the ones from other countries, and even then I don’t deal with them directly. Nowhere in my job description does it say what to do when visitors from another planet show up.” Looking up from his desk, his gaze once again fell on Beep as he asked him, “So you want to see the governor then?”
	“Beep.”
	“It does sound like that’s what he wants; although since he’s an alien you can’t really tell can you? Maybe what sounds like affirmation to us means the opposite where he comes from. But since we don’t know, we might as well just go with it. You said he never says anything other than that?”
	“Sometimes he says it differently,” offered Tucker, the first time he’d spoken since they’d entered the office. McTexas looked at him like he was surprised Tucker could talk, an impression a lot of people got since Tucker could go for hours without saying a single word. It wasn’t that he was stupid, at least not that stupid, it was just that he didn’t have a lot to say.
	“Okay,” said the mayor, who had apparently come to a decision. “I’ll put the word out that you two have an alien and that he wants to meet the governor. In the meantime, I’ll need you two to tell me where you left the UFO, so I can make sure it’s secured. I don’t want anybody vandalizing it while Beep is here.”
	“So, who exactly are you telling?” asked Cletus, trying to pass off his intense interest as idle curiosity and doing a pretty good job of it, although Mayor McTexas wasn’t fooled.
	“Only the governor’s office. If you’re worried about me telling NASA don’t be. They swallow our tax dollars like a god damn sycophant even though they haven’t accomplished diddly-squat since the moon landing, the gits. I swear to God the amount of money being pumped into Houston is ridiculous. Anyways, I’ll let the governor decide what to do next, it’s more his area of expertise I should think. Of course, you two will be going with Beep, since you know him the best. Speaking of which, how do you know he’s a he?”
	“We don’t,” said Cletus as he and Tucker shrugged in unison.`,

      "storypartial" : `“So this is the alien I’ve been hearing so much about from my brother,” said Governor McTexas after the introductions had been made.
	“That’s right.” Cletus looked at the governor oddly. He wondered if they had both changed their name after being elected to their respective offices or if they had been born with it. He had a hard time deciding which was weirder. The two brothers looked so alike they almost had to be twins, and the current gathering was literally as strange as it could possibly be thanks to the silent presence of Beep.
	“Beep,” beeped Beep in agreement, breaking his silence momentarily.
	“Well then,” said Governor McTexas. “I’ve thought about it, and I think our next move should be to go take a look at the UFO. I don’t rightly know why Beep is here exactly, but the military-industrial complex would never forgive me if we didn’t at least try and make a weapon out of the thing. I’ll get on the horn with the army and NASA—”
	“God damn it to hell,” interrupted Mayor McTexas. “Why do we need to bring the gits in on this?”
	“Because they’re the pride and joy of Texas,” retorted the governor. “And they bring in a ridiculous amount of federal money—”
	“Collected from the municipalities,” interrupted the mayor again.
	“Austin, would you shut up for one blasted minute?” Cletus almost lost it at that point. The mayor of Austin, Texas was named Austin McTexas? He wouldn’t have believed it if he hadn’t been standing in a room with an alien from space. Even hearing the name of the mayor in person wouldn’t have made him believe it had Beep not been there to make even that oddity seem normal by comparison. “Anyways,” continued the governor, “I’ll call them up and then we’ll go see about this machine the alien came out of.”
	“What about the president?” asked Tucker suddenly, coming out of the reverie he had been in since they arrived in the governor’s office. “Shouldn’t we call him too?”
	“Heck no!” was the brother’s reply, chorused in unison as if it had been rehearsed. “We don’t need the damn feds interfering in Texas’ business,” concluded the governor, who had just finished praising the same feds for giving his state money. “So, if you boys would be so kind as to give me a moment I’ll make the calls and then we can go.”

	Cletus reflected that events were proceeding rather quickly as he stood in the large group of people next to Beep’s spaceship. Both he and Tucker had been sweating bullets when they passed what remained of Fleming’s corpse, but they needn’t have worried. Even with the empty patrol car right next to it the remains still looked more like road kill than anything else. In any case, the drive back to the spaceship passed without incident, and soon Cletus, Tucker and Beep were right back where they started, albeit with many more people than the first time they had been there.
	With the original trio had come both of the McTexas brothers, a couple of five star generals, and a massive collection of scientists from NASA, at whom Mayor McTexas was glaring with undisguised contempt even as Governor McTexas beamed at them.
	“Well, the president is on his way so let’s make sure we get something before he arrives. I don’t want him to take the credit for this,” said the governor, totally ignoring the fact that the Commander in Chief was the generals’ boss, and had probably been informed of the situation by them in the first place. The generals didn’t comment, so the governor continued. “Can we open the thing?” Cletus wasn’t sure who he was talking to, whether it was him or Tucker or Beep or the generals or the scientists, but it was a scientist who answered.
	“No sir, so far the machine is unresponsive. There aren’t any visible controls or mechanisms on the exterior of the craft, and for that matter there aren’t any visible means of propulsion either.”
	“Well damn,” said Governor McTexas.
	The McTexas brothers continued to powwow with the assembled men and women, throwing ideas around and spitballing, but Cletus noticed that none of them thought to ask Beep himself what to do, or even if he was willing to divulge the secrets of his machine to them. Cletus wondered what Beep would do if they succeeded in opening it without him, remembering all too clearly the fate that had befallen the dearly unloved Officer Fleming. He turned to see how Beep was reacting to all of this discussion about what was rightfully his, but Beep wasn’t paying any attention at all to the proceedings and was in fact having a quiet discussion with Tucker. Apparently they had been wrong about Beep wanting to meet the governor, since Beep had only said one beep to the man since the two had met.
	Tucker was whispering to Beep, who was in turn beeping back at him, and the expression on Tucker’s face was so serious that Cletus decided not to interrupt. Finally somebody in the cluster of federal employees had the bright idea to just ask the alien what to do, and the governor called out to Beep, at the sound of which both Beep and Tucker walked over to him.
	“Cletus,” said Governor McTexas, “can you translate for us?”
	“What?” asked Cletus, totally unprepared for such a request. “I don’t speak his language. I’m not even sure if he has a language.”
	“Yes, yes,” assented the governor impatiently, “but can you ask him some questions for us?”
	“I’ve only ever spoken to him in English; I mean if he can understand me he should be able to understand you.”
	“I understand that,” said the governor, who obviously did not. “But can you just ask him for us if he’d be willing to open the spaceship so we can look around inside?”
	Cletus looked at the governor, and then at the cluster of hopeful faces behind him. Then he looked at Beep, who remained silent as if waiting for Cletus to ask the question he just clearly heard for himself. Lastly, Cletus looked at Tucker, but the big man seemed deep in thought—a rarity for Tucker, who seemed so different lately from how he had been before meeting Beep—and he had nothing to say either way. For lack of a better option, Cletus turned to Beep and dutifully repeated the question to him in exactly the same words the governor had just used.
	“Beep,” said Beep. “Beep beep-beep, beep beep.” Cletus recoiled, thunderstruck. He had never before heard more than one beep at a time. Unseen by all assembled, Tucker seemed to brighten when he heard the statement. Cletus was just amazed at the relative complexity he had heard Beep use for the first time.
Beep walked over to his spaceship, which opened for him automatically, and the diminutive little alien strolled up the ramp and into the spaceship as the ramp closed itself behind him before anyone could react. The generals were frowning at the new development, the scientists were looking at each other with puzzled looks on their faces, the McTexans were awestruck by the spaceship’s ability to open and close a ramp, Cletus was worried about what would happen next, and Tucker was peacefully awaiting some new development.
Then, to everybody’s intense surprise except Tucker’s, the spaceship lifted off the ground, hovered in the air for a moment, and then flew away from Earth so fast it was little more than a twinkling dot in the sky less than a second later.
This was received differently by each group of onlookers. The generals kept frowning, but otherwise they didn’t react. Cletus wondered if any general with a rank of five stars on their lapel was even capable of surprise. The scientists groaned and moaned and complained about a great loss for humankind. Cletus felt sure they were more concerned with the loss to their careers, but he acknowledged that some of Mayor McTexas’ cynicism might have rubbed off on him. The McTexas brothers, after watching the spaceship dwindle away in the distance, turned on their heels, clapped their hands together and treated the whole matter as if it had never happened from that moment onwards. Cletus felt a little let down by the whole event, but he couldn’t help wondering at what exactly Beep had hoped to accomplish on Earth. Whatever it was, he certainly didn’t appear to have done anything other than cruise around in Cletus’ truck for a few days.
After signing a contract ensuring their silence on the matter, Cletus and Tucker were allowed to go home. Tucker was silent for the entire trip, which wasn’t long since they hadn’t been far from the trailer park where they lived next door to each other when they first came across Beep. Cletus drummed his fingers on the wheel, trying to decide what he had been hoping for. Cletus pulled into the parking lot and he and Tucker hopped out of the truck. Then, for a time, the two men just stood there in silent contemplation, each looking back on the preceding days in their own way.`,

      "storypartial" : `“What the hell just happened?” said Cletus finally, meaning the entirety of the past few days.
“Honestly, I have no idea,” sighed Tucker.
“Seriously though, what was Beep even doing here? Did he tell you anything?”
“Not really.” Tucker shrugged his massive shoulders and pulled a cigarette out of the pack in his pocket. “I think you’re looking at it from the wrong angle though. I mean in the movies the aliens always show up for a reason and the heroes get involved and there’s rising action and falling action and the whole nine yards. Who’s to say that’s how aliens really are?”
“Yeah I guess, but no matter what kind of wizardry he used to get here, it’s still a pretty big trip for not a lot of anything.” Cletus motioned for Tucker to hand him a cigarette, and the two of them stood in the late afternoon sun smoking in front of Cletus’ trailer.
“I don’t think so. I mean he said—or beeped—that he wanted to see the governor. He didn’t say he wanted to actually talk to the governor, just see him. And he did, didn’t he? He saw the governor.” Tucker took a drag and exhaled straight up, blowing a cloud that drifted away slowly in the soft breeze.
“I suppose he did,” reflected Cletus. “It just seems like a lot of work just to see the governor of Texas. If he’d hung around a little bit he would have gotten to see the president.”
“Maybe he didn’t want to see him. Or maybe he was just out of time and had to go home. Also he didn’t only see the governor; he also saw the mayor and us, for whatever that’s worth. Maybe he couldn’t even tell the difference. Maybe he left because he thought faces were gross.” Cletus laughed a little at that, and Tucker smiled. “Seriously, aliens are called aliens for a reason. They’re nothing like us; we can’t know what they’re thinking. It’s possible that for Beep meeting the governor was like a field trip or something.”
“Yeah, he didn’t only meet a few people either, he also blew up Fleming.”
“So he did.”
This was met by silence as Cletus and Tucker reminisced on the moment of sweet irony that was Fleming’s demise. For a man so assured of his own power, he probably never expected to be killed by a power greater than himself.
“That was weird huh?” asked Cletus, once again breaking the shared silence.
“Yeah,” agreed Tucker. “That was really weird.”
“Still, I wish I’d known Beep was just gonna leave after a few days without even saying or beeping goodbye. We shelled out a few hundred bucks on him and he didn’t even share the secrets of the universe with us. Maybe he thought we weren’t ready for them, or maybe he didn’t trust us not to turn them into weapons.”
“I don’t think that was it,” said Tucker.
“Why not? Is it because it would be too cliché?”
“No, it’s that he left us with this.” Tucker reached into the waistband of his jeans and pulled out, of all things, Beep’s death ray.
“Holy shit,” breathed Cletus. “He gave you his ray gun? When was this?”
“It was when he was talking to me right before he left. He was beeping at me and I kinda got the idea he was paying us back for helping him or something. I dunno though. He just slipped it to me and then he left.” Tucker shrugged again and laughed. “Seriously I will never understand aliens. You’d think they’d be all peaceful and junk right? But Beep was the god damned most dangerous creature I’ve ever seen. He blew up a police officer, and gave a freaking death ray to literally the first people he met.”
“Don’t forget travelling light years across the galaxy just to meet with the governor,” added Cletus, smiling at the thought.
“I wouldn’t dream of it. So, we got ourselves a ray gun from a homicidal alien. Wanna go blow stuff up?”
“Tucker, you read my fucking mind.”`,
